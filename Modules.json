   "Description": "In this module, we will learn the basics of how a computer is constructed and functions. Additionally we'll practice manipulating numbers in binary and hexadecimal.\n\nThe week-long project is an implementation of an emulator for the LS-8 computer.",
   "Instructor Notes": "This is an aggressive schedule. Try to keep the students on, but if they fall back, it's not a big deal as long as they get mult.ls8 running.  \n\nThere is an LS-8 assembler with label and declared data support. Students do not need to assemble anything for this module, but some might want to use it if they're ranging ahead. Instructors can use it for the sample ls8 code.  \n\nBasic functioning of the emulator is needed for the sprint challenge. The challenge does not rely on the stack or interrupts.  \n\nFriday slack intro:  \n```  \n@channel Guess what!  \n\nNext is _Computer Architecture_! :wooooo: :computer: My favorite!  \n\nFor Monday, I have a couple videos for you: _CPU Functional Components_ and _Binary, Decimal, and Hex_, which are the first two videos in TK: https://learn.lambdaschool.com/cs/module/recsujbrrfgbfucrx\n\nWe'll be going through a guided demo Monday under the assumption that you've watched those first two videos, so please do so. Apologies that they're on the longer side.  \n\n(There are two modules in this sprint, so the project steps in TK are going to be split over Mo/Tu.)  \n\nThe github repo for the entire week is: [https://github.com/LambdaSchool/Computer-Architecture](https://github.com/LambdaSchool/Computer-Architecture)  \n\nLet me know if there are any questions.  \n```  \n\nGuided Demo repo for all days: <https://github.com/LambdaSchool/Computer-Architecture-Guided-Demo>\n\nVisualization of the LS8 showing how *print8*, *stack*, and *call* programs affect the registers, stack, PC etc.<br>\n* [Link to view in browser](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/e/2PACX-1vQ4OAWMdhmUnlYtTIvb-q5Q0qptm-fXdKSsIrdKIFdAbL3JxycQ4ZN0X9gAfNNgeocJ5UiFzRzB-ju_/pub?start=false&loop=false&delayms=60000&slide=id.g4582dfa066_0_526)<br>\n* [Link to edit](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1Wg5cbpRZHJdF-hwepfZqEEHpUbu0PhBJ5xiU_mJVWi0/edit?usp=sharing)\n\n\n**Day 1 lecture:**  \n```\n/polly \"How well do you feel you understand the 30,000-foot view of computer architecture?\" \"0 - not at all\" \"1\" \"2\" \"3 - a lot\"\n\n/polly \"How well do you feel you understand number bases as a concept?\"  \"0 - not at all\" \"1\" \"2\" \"3 - a lot\"\n\n/polly \"How confident are you that you can convert between number bases?\"  \"0 - not at all\" \"1\" \"2\" \"3 - very\"\n```\n\n1.

   "Description": "Up through this point, as you have been working through the Web curriculum, even though data structures were never officially introduced, you were making extensive use of them all the time. Python lists and dictionaries are so useful and versatile that they were included as standard in the language.\n\nIndeed, data structures are extremely prevalent and fundamental when it comes to understanding programming and computer science. By the end of the Computer Science curriculum, you’ll have a good idea of the answers to important questions that were raised during the web curriculum such as ‘how do web servers such as Express effectively and efficiently handle hundreds or thousands of concurrent requests simultaneously?’ or ‘how does a database like MongoDB organize the data that it stores in such a way that it can then retrieve it as quickly as possible?’. Such questions can be answered in part by having an understanding of both the wide berth of all the currently-existing data structures that have been dreamt as well as an adequately deep understanding of how many common data structures work.\n\nAs part of your first Data Structures sprint, we’ll be learning about and implementing some very common and fundamental data structures that are very often used to implement more complex and specialized data structures. These are the:\n\n - Linked List (singly- and doubly-linked)\n - Queue\n - Binary Search Tree\n - Heap\n\nEach of these data structures has its own associated strengths and weaknesses. Think of each of them as a tool in a toolbox. You have entirely different classes of tools such as hammers and wrenches that are each used for entirely different use cases. You also have multiple types of screwdrivers. Both are used for tightening and untightening screws, but the Phillips screwdriver is better for certain screws and the flathead screwdriver is better for other types of screws.\n\nThe same can be said of data structures. There are many instances of wildly different data structures that serve entirely different use cases, and then you have data structures that can both perform the same function, but one will be better at it than the other. More specifically, you could emulate the functionality of a JavaScript Array using an Object, but an Object isn’t going to perform as efficiently when it comes to certain tasks that Arrays are really efficient at.",

We will take you through the high level concepts and help you understand some answers to the following questions:\n* What is React and what potential problems does it address?\n* What tools are required for me to started with a react application? \n* What does react look like syntactically? (How do I write react code using JSX?)\n* What are some of the basic patterns I will see when building React Applications? (Components etc.)",
   "Instructor Notes": "Students should be lead through a discussion about \"Why React is important\" and \"what problems it solves\". When learning something as complicated as React it is important to understand context. Providing examples of how the React API works with `React.CreateClass()` and wiring up a simple React App within an HTML document is a really good segway into how react fits together. Once we abstract that away with the `class` keyword it becomes really difficult to understand the context. This is impertive to learning the library and it's api at first.\n\n*Solution Code for the Afternoon Projects* \n\nStudents can follow along building this out during the lecture. Each objective you take it a step further. Starting with `React.createElement()` -> then `JSX` -> then -> `components`. This will allow you to see the progression of this come to fruition right before your eyes. AND the students LOVE it.\n\nhttps://gist.github.com/ryanhca/b23529ae7aaf28f885ead2eed955852a\n\nI have added a step to the above. I have been creating a custom createElement function that takes in a type, a className, and content and creates a custom element. Then it returns that custom element, and we add it to the DOM. The I replace my custom function with React.createElement. Here is the example gist:\n\nhttps://gist.github.com/dustinmyers/9a5bd605e2c85aeb3ecbd63315e370a3\n\n*Gotcha* for this lesson - Don't forget to teach how to import/export components in a regular file structure. This is required in the afternoon project, and it will really throw off students if it's not discussed.",

   "Instructor Notes": "TODO: objective videos\n\nhttps://github.com/LambdaSchool/Theory-Of-Computation\n(Note:  The above repository contains the same info as is in the Training Kit)\n\n#Rough Schedule\nThis is a two-day module/project.  Don't panic!  There is a huge amount of content here, but this lesson is intended to provide an overview of the fundamentals of computer theory and give context to the work that we do.  \n\nDay 1 lecture:  Theory of Computing and Intro to State Machines\n*[Min 0 - 20]  Start with asking for opinions and thoughts on Thomson's videos.  Keep the discussion on track, but let it flow around between the different areas that the students found interesting or pertinent.\n\n*[Min 20 - 40] Using the info in the TK as a guide, review the history of computing and why it is important.  Key points:\n**Much of this has been around for a very long time.  The foundations of what became our Boolean algebra started with Greek philosophers in 300 BCE.\n**  The formal definition of a Turing machine looks a little complex and confusing.  The important point here is that this represents two things:\n1.  Before this, no one knew if general computing was possible.  There were many mechanical computers that did one specific task, such as adding machines, navigational aids, or even the Antikythera mechanism.  But it was unknown if a machine could be constructed that could compute any algorithm that could be calculated by a person by hand.  Turing, Church, and others proved that it was.  Any mathematical process that can be computed by a person, can be computed by a machine of this type.\n2.  While they proved that general computing was possible, they also proved that there is a set of problems that are inherently unsolvable by computing/algorithms/computers, whether by hand or by machine (specifically, the halting problem).\n[20 mins]  Discuss the background of logic and math as it relates to CS.  Ancient Greek philosophy eventually led to  if(a == b), etc.\n\n[Min 40 - 60] Intro to finite state machines.\n**  Digital/Discrete vs. Continuous/Analog.  Computers are very complex, deterministic, finite state machines\n**  Important for mindset of computing.  Can you draw a diagonal line with a computer?\n**  Also useful for converting abstract processes into computer thinking.  \n\n[Min 60 - 65] Break\n\n[Min 65 - 85] Explain examples of state machines in TK\n\n[Min 85 - 105] Show the state machine creator at madebyevan.com/fsm/  and walk the class through creating an improved version of the vending machine state machine that can handle invalid coins and give change.\n\n[Min 105 - 110] Answer questions\n\n[Min 110 - 120]  Introduce the project (https://github.com/LambdaSchool/Theory-Of-Computation)\nStudents should complete the state diagram exercise tonight and if they have time should look over the regex challenge for tomorrow.\n\nDay 2 Lecture:  Regular Expressions\n[Min 0 - 20] Solution lecture for the blinker diagram and for a video game AI.\n\n[Min 20 - 50] Start with state machines applied to the task of going through a string characters and changes states with the input of certain characters to read through and complete if it finds...\n1.  goal\n2.  gooooal - or any variant with o's\n3.  goooool - also allow for a Spanish varient of the spelling \n4.  Build with letters as input to go forward and not letters [^g], etc. to go backwards.\n5.  Reduce the final state machine diagram to a regular expression \n    a.  Use regular expression notation for the inputs - o+ and a?\n    b.  It is implied that it will reset if it fails, so get rid of the return to starts\n\n[Min 50 - 55] Break\n\n[Min 55 - 95] Introduce regexr.com and run through the example there\n* Different variations of goal and gol\n* Discuss flags\n* Explore the built in reference and test out other types of symbols that can be used\n* Demo attempting to pull email addresses out of a block of text.  Discuss why a full-proof solution is difficult.\n* Demo greedy vs. lazy\n\n[Min 95 - 115] Demonstrate regex in JavaScript in a Node instance\n*  Share the Mozilla reference page and refer to it in the demo:  https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/RegExp\n*  Demo s.match with goal: \ns = \"goooal\";\ns.match(/go+al/);\n* Demo the difference in results when you use capturing groups (parens around parts of the regex)\n* Store this in a variable (m = s.match(...)\n* Store regex in variable r\n* Show r.exec(s) as the inverse of s.match(r)\n* Show the /g flag returning all possible results instead of the first\n\n\n[Min 115 - 120]\nAnswer questions.  Remind everyone about the second part of the project - pulling links from StackOverflow, and matching phone numbers.\n\nLead the class to making the decision to start by figuring out the regexes needed for the project using the tools in regexr.\n\n",

Part of it is directory information (e.g. file name, size, location information). Another part of it is keeping track of which blocks are allocated.\n\nStart the students off with the following givens:\n* You have a disk that is addressable by block (AKA sector) number, blocks 0-9999999.\n* Each block holds 1024 bytes of data.\n* The filesystem does _not_ need to support subdirectories.\n* You should be able to store multiple files of various sizes.\n\n## Known solutions\n\n### Commodore64-ish\n\n* For keeping track of free blocks, some blocks hold a map of boolean values. If a value in the map is false for a particular block, that means the block is available. Think of it as a big array of `bool`s, packed in as individual bits.\n* The directory is kept in a well-known location on disk somewhere. It is a list of entries that hold name and size information, as well as the number of the first block in the file data.\n* For tracking where file data is, the filesystem uses a linked list structure. The first (or last) bytes of the block are reserved as a pointer to the next block. A pointer value of `0` indicates the last block of the file. The exact size of the file can be determined from the directory entry.\n\n### Unix-ish, inodes\n\n* A list of free blocks is kept in a well-known location on disk. When a new block is allocated, it is removed from the free list.\n* The directory is kept in a well-known location on disk. It holds _inodes_, where there is 1 inode per file. The inode holds the name, size, etc. as well as a handful of pointers to the first blocks of the file.\n* If those few pointers are not enough to refer to all the blocks the file needs, the inode includes a _single indirect_ pointer to a block. This block is a list of additional blocks in the file.\n* If the direct and indirect block lists are not enough, the inode also has a _double indirect_ pointer to a block. This block is a list of pointers to single indirect blocks, which are all pointers to blocks.\n* [Image of the above and more info](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inode_pointer_structure)\n\n# Project Notes\nThis is the implementation of a web server in C.\n\nAll the hard stuff is written in the skeleton on the `master` branch. Networking is included. The main loop is included.\n\nThe work the students have to do is:\n* Understand how HTTP works, what requests and responses look like.\n* Be able to do a lot of string manipulation in C.\n   * They have to parse request headers.\n   * They have to build responses.\n* Be able to add code to an existing codebase.\n\nIntroduce this project by describing it as (one of the) first opportunities they have to work on something more like a real world programming task in C.  They will be working in a small part of a larger project.  \n\nThey do not need to understand the specific details of the entire project any more than you would need to know the entire layout of a city to follow directions from one address to another.  \n\nInstead, help them get started by walking through the process of orienting themselves to the program and finding their bearings.  To do this, we need to find out where we are and what our first task is to start us in the right direction:\n1.  Read over the instructions in detail (this should be done before class)\n2.  Skim over the program to get an idea of what it entails.  Don't worry to much about the complicated and esoteric functions at the top.  Just acknowledge that they are complicated and esoteric, then move on.\n3.  Recognize the `handle_http_request()` function from the `Main Goals` of the readme.  This is where we start!\n4.  Acknowledge that this is where we start, and move on to review the rest of the program.  \n5.  Compile!  Then make the minor changes necessary to successfully compile the program.  \n6.  We know that we're supposed to do something with `handle_http_request()`.  Write a comment in that function, then compile and \n6.  We are ready to start.  Refer back to the `Main Goals`.  Our first task is the simplest thing we can parse out of here.  In this case, it is to \n\n[See the README for more info](https://github.com/LambdaSchool/C-Web-Server).",

   "Name": "Scheduling",
   "2 Days": "",
   "Description": "Now that we've talked a bit about processes and you know that every program running on your computer is a process that\nthe operating system kernel much allocate CPU time for, it's time to talk about how the OS kernel performs this task.\n\nIn essence, there is a special program the kernel executes called the scheduler, whose sole job is to decide, out of \nall of the processes vying for execution time from the CPU, which one actually gets to go next? There are many algorithms\nthat can be used to answer this question. Some examples include:\n\n * First In, First Out: Super simple and easy to implement, but what happens when a really long process comes along\n right before a bunch of short jobs. At that point, our scheduler algorithm is extremely inefficient.\n\n * Shortest Job First: Also very simple and easy to implement, but it's unfair to processes that may require a lot of\n processing time, but are very important.\n\n  * Round Robin: Definitely the most fair scheduling algorithm, since every process will get attention from the CPU and\n  at least make some progress on running to completion, but then performance may be affected since we're spreading CPU\n  time between many different vying processes all at once. \n\nSo it turns out, when it comes to deciding on a good scheduling algorithm, there are a number of criteria that need to \nbe accounted for and balanced. We want our scheduler to minimize _turnaround time_, which is defined as the amount of \ntime from when a process completed execution and when that process first arrived in the queue of processes. This is \nimportant because we don't want unfinished processes sitting around for longer than they need to.\n\nWe also want to minimize _response time_, which is defined as the amount of time from when a process gets scheduled\nand when it first arrived in the scheduler's queue. This is also important because we want processes to get scheduled\nas soon as possible. Notice though how a scheduling algorithm like Shortest Job First minimizes turnaround time at the \ndirect cost of response time, since shortest jobs are prioritized above longer processes, meaning the longer processes\ndon't get completed (or even scheduled) for a long time. \n\nLikewise, with a Round Robin scheduling algorithm, better response time is achieved at the direct cost of turnaround \ntime, since processes get scheduled and start executing very quickly, but processes take more time overall to complete.\n\nThere are other constraints as well placed upon the operating system scheduler that I haven't even mentioned. One of the \nbig ones is that the operating system doesn't actually know how long a process needs to run for. That's _impossible_ to \nknow. So it turns out that an algorithm like Shortest Job First isn't even actually possible! On top of that, processes\ncould go into a blocking state, like if it needs to perform some I/O operation. In that case, the scheduler will want \nto be efficient and yield the CPU to another process waiting in line, since the blocking process isn't going to make\nprogress towards completing until its I/O operation is complete. \n\nSo the fundamental question underlying the concept of scheduling is: what scheduling algorithm will allow us to \nminimize both turnaround time and response time without actually knowing how long each process needs to run for, \nplus account for the fact that processes may enter a blocking state? There are, of course, other factors to \nconsider for OS developers who write real, everyday-use scheduling algorithms, but these constraints are enough \nfor a relatively simple implementation.\n\n### Multi-level Feedback Queue\n\nOne of the most well-known approaches to tackling the problem of scheduling is the Multi-level Feedback Queue, or MLFQ. \nThe MLFQ attempts to address the constraints we just mentioned by \"learning\" the characteristics of each process as the \nsystem runs, so that it can make better scheduling decisions.\n\nThe architecture of the MLFQ comprises of a number of distinct queues, each assigned a different priority level. At any \ngiven time, a process that is ready to run is placed on a single queue. The MLFQ uses priority levels to decide which \nprocess should run at a given time. Of course, more than one process may be in a given queue, and thus have the same \npriority, in which case the MLFQ runs these processes in round-robin fashion. \n\nThe key to the MLFQ lies in how the scheduler sets priorities. Rather than giving a fixed priority to each process, the \nMLFQ varies the priority of each process based upon its observed behavior. For example, if a process repeatedly relinquishes \nthe CPU because it's waiting on input, the MLFQ will keep its priority high, since this process may be interactive, and \nnecessitates high response time. If a process uses the CPU intensively for long periods of time, the MLFQ will reduce its \npriority level. In this way, the MLFQ tries to learn about processes as they run, and thus use the history of the process \nto predict its future behavior.",

My name's Beej--I'm one of the instructors here at LS and I'm stoked to be working with you this coming week.\n\nWe're about to start Algorithms! :wooooo: \n\nThis is one of the most challenging weeks at Lambda, and it comes out swinging. It's incredibly difficult material for virtually everyone, myself included. If the answers don't immediately spring out at you, welcome to the club. :slightly_smiling_face: \n\nBut no one goes to the gym to have an easy time of things. We're going to work hard and reap those benefits. After this week, normal everyday problems you'll get at work will seem relatively trivial.\n\nThe most important thing for these first two days is to _practice_ solving these hard problems. We're less concerned that you get the answer than that you _try super hard_ to get the answer. It's 10 points for copying the answer online, 1000000 points for working hard on the problem, and 1 additional bonus point for getting the answer.\n\nIt's the process of attacking the problem that gets you the learning gain. You'll get out what you put in.\n\nWe have some pre-class vids to watch on TK to get started with:\n\n* _Runtime Complexity_\n* _Recursion_\n* _A First Pass Solution_\n\nGive 'em a watch before class so we can hit the ground running.\n\nhttps://learn.lambdaschool.com/cs/module/recrcuzqmvi6lvxhd\n\nIf you want to get a head start on the week's material, you can find the repo here: https://github.com/LambdaSchool/Algorithms\n\nHave a good weekend!\n__________\n\n## Day 1\n\n__________\n@channel It's day 1 of Algorithms! Let's get started!\n\n* Why are we discussing this?\n* Some simple algorithms\n* Algorithmic analysis and Big-O\n__________\n\nTalk more about recursion in depth. Use recursion to solve the recursive string permutations problem. Also walk students through the problem of implementing a stack class that can always access the largest element in the stack in constant time. Use this problem as an opportunity to talk about how to improve the runtime of some functionality from O(n) to O(1). \n    1. Write a recursive contains function that receives an array and a target and returns True if the target is in the array and False otherwise.\n\n    2. Implement a stack class with all the usual stack functionality, and with the added functionality that it can access the largest element in the stack in constant time. \n\n\n___________\n\n@channel More vids for your viewing pleasure!\n\nBack on TK for algorithms, Sean chats about improving a first-pass solution. It's additional coverage on dynamic programming and other techniques.\n\nhttps://learn.lambdaschool.com/cs/module/recrcuzqmvi6lvxhd\n\nAnd then on the data structures side, the first two vids, _Linked Lists_ and _Queues_ (~25 mins total) are a good start after you wrap your Algs stuff.\n\nhttps://learn.lambdaschool.com/cs/module/recuhkmtdyvwmexmz\n\nRemember: when you're working out the algorithms problems, look on them as sources of curiosity rather than frustration. They way problems behave when you attack them is something to be studied and explored here in the safety of Lambda.\n___________\n\n\n## Day 2\n\n```\n/polly \"I attacked the following problems (check all that apply)\" \"Stocks\" \"Recipes\" \"Stairs\" \"RPS\" \"Change\" \"Knapsack\"\n\n/polly \"I solved the following problems (check all that apply)\" \"Stocks\" \"Recipes\" \"Stairs\" \"RPS\" \"Change\" \"Knapsack\"\n\n/polly \"Confidence on Big-O\" \"0%\" \"25%\" \"50%\" \"75%\" \"100%\"\n```\n\nTalk about some different algorithmic problem-solving approaches such as the greedy approach. Note that the term \"greedy approach\" is different from the greedy heuristic that might be used as a strategy in order to get a \"good enough\" answer to the knapsack problem. Use it to solve the problem of finding the highest product of 3 integers in an array in linear time. Use these problems as an opportunity to look at how to improve the runtime of an initial first-pass algorithm.\n    1. Given an array of integers, find the highest product of any three integers in the array in linear time.\n\n    2. Given an array of integers, find the cumulative product of every integer except the one at the current index.\n",

Change and modify the graph to demonstrate:\n* Weighted vs. Unweighted\n* Directed vs. Undirected\n* Cyclic vs. Acyclic\n\nDirected Acyclic Graphs are what Git uses for commits\n\nDuring this portion, provide the answers to the pre-course video exercises: \n\nDraw examples of the following:\n\nUndirected graph of 4 verts.\nDirected graph of 5 verts.\nCyclic directed graph of 6 verts.\nDAG of 7 verts.\n\n(Min 40 - 50)\nDraw a new, or refer to an existing, simple graph on the whiteboard and discuss the different ways that could be used to organize this information. \n\n## Using an Adjacency Matrix\n\n```\n   A B C D\n +--------\nA | 0 0 1 1\nB | 0 0 1 0\nC | 1 0 0 1\nD | 1 0 1 0\n```\n\nIn the above example B connects to C, but C does not connect back to B.\n\n## Using an Adjacency List\n\nAnother way is to store a list of verts that a particular vert connects\nto.\n\n```\nA -> [ C D ]\nB -> [ C ]\nC -> [ A D ]\nD -> [ A C ]\n```\n\nThis is the recommended approach for our graph projects.\n\nDiscuss the relative strengths and weaknesses.\n\n(Min 50 - 60)\nAsk for questions and answer them.\n\nLet the class know that after the break we will be switching gears and learning how to draw with Canvas.\n\nPause the video, shut down screen share, audio, and video, and take a break.\n\n(Min 60-75)\n\nAsk the class to remind you what it is you are supposed to be doing.  As always, this is a prompt to regularly check the readme/specs/project docs to make sure that you are on track, understand the requirements or task, and are budgeting your time properly.\n\nReview the steps listed in the readme, gather that we are supposed to be using canvas to draw the graph.  This is an excellent opportunity to work with the class to practice reviewing a document and determining where to start implementation - which is not always the item at the top of the page!  In this case, it will be much easier to tell if our graph classes are working properly if we can draw them on the screen.  As such, suggest that we should skip the first task and implement the second - drawing in canvas. \n\nOpen up the project and review the code.  Ask what it does and guide the class to prompt you to test it and try to get it running.  Fix any issues encountered so that it runs (adding variables for canvas size).\n\nAsk the class if it is working or not, and how we can tell.  As always, the answer is testing.  Search the code for references to canvas, find where the background is drawn, and experiment with changing the color.\n\n(Min 75-105)\nAsk the class how canvas works and insist that you have no idea.  Guide them to prompt you to use google to research how it works and test out different functions contained within it. \n\nDemonstrate drawing lines, drawing circles, filling them, and drawing text.  Explore fill and stroke styles and get the students to guide you to how to change them.\n\nKeep adding to your work and work towards some sort of artistic endeavor (it doesn't have to be pretty :) )\n\nDraw particular attention to the fact that this works like a paintbrush and each new step will overwrite any pixels that were previously changed. \n\nDiscuss the pitfalls associated with making sure drawing shapes is bracketed with beginPath() and stroke() and demonstrate the use of the moveTo() function.  Implement this incorrectly at first and lead a troubleshooting exercise to figure out why it doesn't draw what we want. \n\n(Min 105-110)\n\nAnswer any questions.\n\n(Min 110 - 120)\n\nWhat should the class do with project time?\n\nSend the class off with the day's project - to grow comfortable with canvas by creating several modern art pieces using canvas.  Demonstrate how loops can be used to create gradients, interesting spirograph type shapes, etc.\n\nRemind the class to watch the pre-class video before tomorrow morning. \n\n\n#####################DAY 2:########################\n\nObjectives Covered\n* describe what breadth-first (BFS) is and its uses...\n\nOther goals\n* practice developing your own specs/pseudocode from a problem\n\nPre-class video\nThe pre-class video covers how do do a breadth-first search on a simple graph.  This is the first of many times this process will be covered during this lesson.\n\n(Min 0 - 10)\nIntroduce the topic, poll viewership of the pre-class video and remind of the importance of watching these.  Discuss the demonstration of the breadth-first search and do a quick and very high level review of the process.  Ask the class to keep this in mind when thinking about the day's task.\n\nSet the stage!  Share an overview of what the agenda for the day and week are going to be.\n\nToday we are going to be figuring out what we need in classes that represent the different parts of the graph, how they relate, and how to draw them on the screen using canvas. \n\nAsk the class where to start.  If need be, ask leading questions to get to the answer for where to go when unsure of what to do - the readme/docs/specs, etc.  Review the six parts of the project and discuss the progress that has been made so far:  That we skipped the first step and went to the second.\n\nNow that we have a way to see what our work does, it is time to implement part 1 of the project.\n\n(Min 10 - 15)\n\nAfter figuring out what we are going to work on, we next need to figure out where our work should go.  Ask the class where we should write our code and lead them to the answer that we don't know yet, so we should review the existing code base.\n\nGuide an overview of the code, focusing on graph.js, as we covered app.js in Day 1.  Review all of the functions and discuss what they might do.  Look for clues to guide us in the other functions, in both comments that our colleague who wrote the other parts left to help us, and in the functionality and structure of other functions or methods that might interact with the same code or data as we are.  In this case, randomize() and dump() are particularly helpful.\n\n(Min 15 - 30)\n\nUsing clues gleaned from the comments and codes, we can determine that our edge function needs a constructor with parameters for the destination and weight of the edge.  Discuss why the edge doesn't need an origin and lead towards the reason that because it is owned by a vertex, that information is already stored.  Also discuss the advantages of storing a reference to the entire destination vertex, instead of just the position of that vertex.\n\nexport class Edge {\n constructor(destination, weight=1) {\n   this.destination = destination;\n   this.weight = weight;\n }\n}\n\nNext, implement the Vertex class.  We know from the docs and from other classes that each vertex will need a variable in which to store it's name, called 'value', and the list of vertexes that originate from it.  Although not done in the solution repo, we can go ahead and add an object called pos with x and y variables so that we remember it needs to be there.  By initializing it with a default of -1, -1, we can have a clue to follow if something later goes wrong with the positioning code.\n\nexport class Vertex {\n constructor(value='vertex', pos = { x: -1, y: -1 }) {\n   this.value = value;\n   this.edges = [];\n   this.pos = pos;\n }\n}\n\nFinally, the graph class has an array of vertexes, so we don't need to do any implementation there.\n\n(Min 30 - 45)\n\nNow we need to find a way to make sure that our edge and vertex classes are built correctly.  How do we do this?\n\nTesting.  But how can we test?  Take a look at the randomize function and discuss its suitability for testing. \n\nPros:\n* It is already written and committed to the repo.  Although we should never assume other code works, we can say that it will likely produce a valid graph. \n* If we use this for testing, when we get it working, we'll be done implementing it.\n\nCons:\n*. This is a large and complicated function that we might not entirely understand.  It would take time to gain a complete understanding of it so that we know how it works and what to expect.\n*. The function creates random data.  This is usually bad for testing, because we can't be sure if a result is because of a mistake in our code, or a random occurrence that appears to be a bug, but is actually an edge case of correct behavior. \n\nIn this case, it's probably best to make some test data so we know exactly what to expect.  But how we do that?  By making a debug function to generate test data.\n\nBy asking guided questions, get the class to help you build a very simple graph using our classes:\n\ndebugCreateTestData(){\n let vertex1 = new Vertex (\"test1\", {x: 50, y: 50);\n let vertex2 = new vertex (\"test2\", {x: 50, y: 50);\n\n let edge1 = new Edge(vertex2);\n vertex1.push(edge1);\n\nvertexes.push(vertex1, vertex2);\n}\n\nNow that we have it, what next?  We test!  But where should we call it?  Guide the class in reviewing the code again and settle on the place in app.js where we will eventually call randomize(). \n\nNow we need to confirm that this is working.  A good test would be to verify that graph.vertexes is being created and populated with our test data.  The first place to test is by doing a console.log(\"List of Vertexes in App Constructor\", this.state.graph.vertexes) right under where we called our debugCreateTestData() function.\n\nIf this works, it's a good start, but it isn't where we need it, so the next place is to test in the draw function.  Use questions to guide the class to the function where we are drawing in the canvas and try writing to console again.  Discover that this.state... doesn't work here and refresh on how props work in react.js.\n\n(Min 45-60)\nAsk the class what to do next and refer back to the readme briefly to get a reminder that we need to draw the graph using canvas.  A good place to start would be the first circle.  We know exactly where it is supposed to be, and what its label is.\n\nGuide the class iteratively through drawing the circle, filling it, and printing the label.  This is a good chance to talk about magic numbers and create a constant for radius rather than putting in an arbitrary number.\n\n(Min 60-75)\nAfter successfully drawing one circle, the next step is to draw all of them.  Guide the class in wrapping a for...of loop around the code and modify it to support iterating through the entire array of vertexes and drawing them.  This is a good opportunity to discuss refactoring code and renaming variables as needed to make sense after the changes. \n\n(Min 75-90)\n[[Depending on cohort and pacing, it may be better to have this be the task for project time.  I did that for CS7 and 8 -Brian]]\n\nUse the same process as for the circle to guide the class to draw the lines for the edges.  Allow mistakes in drawing order to be made and guide corrections of them.\n\nWe may end up with two iterations through the graph.vertexes array.  If this happens, fix it if there is time.  If the lesson is running behind, use this as a teaching example that code can always be made better, but our first task is to get it completely functional.  Leave a \"TODO\"  comment to optimize it later.\n\n(Min 90 - 95).\nAt this point, the drawing code appears to be complete and functional, but we can't be sure yet.  More testing is needed to validate our code.  Return to debugCreateTestData().  Add, modify, and remove several vertexes and edges to confirm the drawing code is working as expected.\n\n(Min 95-100)\nThe great thing about our approach is that we have built our drawing code to draw whatever is in graph.vertexes.  It doesn't matter where the data originates.  This means that we can do a 1 for 1 swap of our debug function and randomize().  Guide the class to discover and implement this revelation.\n\nMin 105-110)\n\nAnswer questions.\n\n(Min 110 - 120)\n\nWhat should the class do with project time?\n\nReview the readme, because whenever we are unsure of what to do next, this is where we look - specs/docs/etc.  This is another opportunity to discuss time management, and picking which part of a project to implement next. \n\nPhase 4 is a doozie.  There is little information on what we need to do, and a quick google search suggests that this is a complicated topic!  Some of our time should definitely be spent researching and preparing for this.  As such, the project work for tonight should focus on doing a BFS on paper or whiteboard and working out pseudocode and/or a process for how it works. \n\nPhase 5 looks less difficult.  It would be good to spend some time researching and testing methods to draw vertexes using random colors. \n\nPhase 6 is pretty straightforward.  Students who remember their react may want to go ahead and implement this now.  If they do, they can help the rest of us figure it out when we do it in class on Thursday.\n\nRemind the class to review the pre-class video on connected components before tomorrow.",

Share an overview of what the agenda for the day and week are going to be.\n\nToday we are going to do a whiteboard exercise and learn how to do a breadth-first search.  During this process, we will document our process and end up with a pseudo-code version of the algorithm.\n\nReview what the task is by taking another look at the readme.  Cover what we’ve done so far, and what our next tasks are.\n\nAsk how the class did with their attempts to do a BFS on paper.  Also find out if anyone was able to implement random colors and/or the reset button.\n\n(Min 15-30)\nAs you complete the demonstrations in the next few segments\n\nOpen up the whiteboard and show the demo for the test.  Ask about connected components and have the class identify the ones present.  Discuss how it is easy for us to see this, but it is a more difficult problem for the computer, because the computer can only look at one thing at a time.  It can’t see the bigger picture like we can.\n\nPick a starting spot.  Add this step to the process and ask the class to guide you through walking step by step across the graph.  Think about what we need to write down to do so - the places we’ve been, is the first thing, so write that down, and add this to the process.\n\nNext, we need to look at it’s connections.  Since we can only look at them one at a time, we need to figure out which order to go in.  We know from our research that the BFS should start at the origin and expand outward.  Add exploring connections to the process. \n\nDemonstrate that it doesn’t matter which order we go in, but it is important that you keep track of where you have been so that you don’t get stuck in a loop.  Demonstrate following a few different orders of edges and add “places visited” to the list of things you need to keep track of.\nThis is a good place to reinforce the concept that this type of search does not find THE best answer to the problem.  It only finds an answer that is A best solution.  There may be many others that are equally good.\n\n(Min 30-60)\nAlthough the order we visit each edge of a particular vertex doesn’t matter, the order in which vertexes are visited does matter.  In a breadth first search, the definition states that they should be visited in the order that they are discovered.\n\nAsk what kind of programming structure is used to process items in a first-in-first-out basis and find the answer of a queue.  Add a queue to the paper structure and demonstrate it in operation.\n\nDemonstrate that process can be modified to add vertexes to the visited list when they are discovered, rather than when they are actually visited, so that the presence or absence of the vertex in the visited list can be used to determine if it should be added to the queue or not.  \n\nFurther demonstrate the search and use this demonstration to further refine the written process.\n\n(Min 60-65)\nBreak\n\n(Min 65-90)\nFurther refine the process to\n\nCreate a group designation and mark each discovered vertex with that group\nHandle situations where the queue is empty\nGo to the next unvisited vertex going by order of label\nIncrement the group number\n\nFinish the run-through of the process on the first graph, further refining it if necessary.\n\n(Min 90-105)\n\nPull up the second graph.  Ask the class to lead you through a complete run through.  Follow their instructions and only correct if they are off track.  Try to get as many students as possible to participate in giving instructions.\n\nShow that the process can also be modified to track the parent of each vertex.  This gives the shortest path from any vertex, back to the first in the collection.\n\nFurther refine the process into pseudo-code if needed.\n\nMin (105-110)\n\nAnswer questions.\n\n(Min 110 - 120)\n\nWhat should the class do with project time?\n\nRefer to the readme for remaining tasks.  Project time today should be used to implement BFS in code.  A few pointers to share:\nThe stated goal is to color each connected component.  There are two approaches that will work.  \nCreate a random color for each set and mark the color of each vertex when it is visited.\nCreate a list of connected components and use the list do the colors at drawing time\nThe BFS algorithm should find one connected component.  It needs to be called several times to find them all\n\n\n#####################DAY 3:########################\n\n\nObjectives Covered\n* describe a depth-first search and its uses...\n\nOther goals                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 \n* Complete the BFS in code.\n\nPrecourse Video Topics\nThe precourse video covers depth first searches. \n\n(Min 0 - 10)\n\nCheck in with the class and poll viewership of the pre-course video. \n\nSet the stage!  Share an overview of what the agenda for the day and week are going to be.\n\nToday we are going to switch gears for a moment, and start with learning how to do a depth-first search on the whiteboard, and come up with pseudo-code - the same process we did yesterday, but a different approach.\n\nAsk the class to explain a depth first search and how it differs from BFS.  A DFS can be thought of as being the opposite of a BFS.  Rather than moving outward in rings, and dealing with vertexes in the order that they are discovered, we move outward as far as possible, and explore any vertex immediately on discovery.  When we get to a dead end, we retreat until we can move outward again.\n\nDo a quick demonstration of the path that is taken without worrying too much about the process for this pass.\n\nDiscuss how the result of a DFS is A minimum spanning tree, showing the smallest connection between the vertexes.  As with BFS, the result can be one of many possible best results, but it will be tied for the best.\n\n(Min 10-40)\nOpen the third sample graph in the whiteboard.\n\nRepeat the process from yesterday to build a process for a depth first search.  Start with discussing the differences in which vertex is given priority and using a stack vs. a queue.\n\nThe process from yesterday can be modified, or a new one created.  The end result should be similar to:\n\nIf the stack is empty, add the next unvisited node to the stack and increment the group number and mark it visited and as being in the new group\nMove to the node at the top of the stack\nIf the node has an unvisited connection, mark that connection as visited and add it to the top of the stack and go to step 2\nIf there are no unvisited connections, remove the node from the top of the stack and go to step 2\n\nGuide the class as needed to stay on time, but try to let them devise the solution.\n\n(Min 40-50)\nLet the class know that we are switching back to BFS.  Erase the whiteboard marks from the DFS, and lead the class through a fast repetition of the BFS.\n\n(Min 50-55)\nBreak\n\n(Min 55-70)\nNow, it is time to convert our process and/or pseudocode into actual code.  First, we need to figure out where to do this.\n\nAsk the class how to approach the problem and where to put the code.  We could start a new files, or put it in one of our existing ones.\n\nAs always, the answer is to check the docs and existing code.  In this case, the docs aren’t very helpful, though the do include another pseudocode version of BFS.  A re-review of the code gives the answer - our colleague has set up stubs for where this code should go.\nWe should also think about how we are going to test the large and complicated function we are about to write.  \n\nAsk the class why randomize might not be the best function to test with.  The answer, as before, is that anything that produces random data has a higher risk of obscuring issues with debugging and may give the appearance of a correct result when bugs still remain.  As such, we should switch back to our test data.\n\nAdjust debugCreateTestData() so that it will build a few small sets of connected components.\n\nWe also need to figure out where to call BFS.  Lead a discussion with the class and come to the conclusion that for now, it makes sense to call BFS immediately after graph.vertexes is filled by debugCreateTestData().  Add the call.  It needs an argument for the start parameter, so feed it graph.vertexes[0] for now.\n\n(Min 70-105)\n\nNext it would be good to do a simple test to make sure that it is being called and everything is connected the way we think it is.  \n\nA good way to start would be to use the function to change the color of a vertex.  Create a variable for groupColor and initialize it as “red”. \n\nAsk how we should tell the first vertex to be the groupColor, and have the class prompt you that vertex has a variable for color.  Make start.color = groupColor.\n\nRun it and ask why it hasn’t changed the color of the vertex.  The answer is that we still have the fill color in our drawing code hard-coded to be “white”.  Change this to vertex.color.\n\nThe first vertex should now render red.  Now we need to get more of them to be changed to groupColor.  We need to convert the pseudo-code into actual code.  What was our pseudo-code again?\n\nAs always, the answer is to look at the docs.  In this case, we’ve actually made the documentation ourselves!  Refer back to the whiteboard where the process is written down.  Copy it, and paste it as comments into bfs().\n\nAsk the class to look at the pseudocode/process.  We already have our variable for group, is there anything else we need?  We need a queue.  What type of data structure makes the most sense to store a list of items in a specified order?  An array.  Create an array for queue.\n\nNext take a look at the overall process.  We know that we need to do some kind of loop involving the queue array,, but we’re going to be adding and removing stuff, and we don’t know at the start how many items we need to deal with.  Ask what kind of loop is best for this - a while loop.  \n\nWhat is the condition that we should keep going?  If the queue is not empty.  This also means that we need to “prime the pump”  \n\nAdd the while loop, and above it add the vertex in start to the array.  \n\nWhat’s next?  According to the pseudo-code, we need to loop through each edge in the vertex, and add where it points to the queue, and mark it as being visited.  Since we know exactly how many times we need to iterate, we can use a for each loop.  \n\nHow do we tell if a vertex has been visited?  We could make a list of the ones that have been visited and check against that, but we can also use the properties within each vertex.  They start with a color of “white”, so we can change the color when we find each one, and use that to both tell if it is undiscovered and change the color for drawing.\n\nInside the loop, if an edge has a destination that has a color that is not white:\nChange the color to groupColor\nAdd the destination to the end of the queue array (push)\n\nRun and test the code several times.  Fix any bugs, and ask the class to observe what is happening and theorize why.\n\nWhatever connected component the first vertex is in will turn red, but no other components will change.  Why?  Because we haven’t yet done the last part of the pseudocode - if the queue becomes empty, we are done with this set and should move to the next connected component.\n\nHow can this be translated to code?  There are several approaches, but a clue was given to us by our colleague in the connected components stub.\n\nWe can use the getConnectedComponents() function to call bfs() for each vertex, if that vertex has not yet been visited.  Add a for each loop of the vertexes list and call bfs on each vertex that has not yet had its color changed.\n\nTest and observe that nothing has changed - because we forgot to call the new function.  Ask where this should go, and lead the class to the answer that it should replace where bfs() is called in app.js\n\nWe’re almost done, but everything is turning red, and that’s not what we want - we want each connected component to be a different random color.\n\nAsk the class how to generate a random color, then use google and grab a function and add it to graphs.js.  Discuss other potential locations for this type of function.  If there are going to be a lot of similar types of functions in the project, it’s often good to move them to a separate file of helper functions.  But for now, it’s fine to add it above bfs().\n\nNow, all that is needed is to use the random color function to generate groupColor, rather than hardcoding.\n\nBuild, run, debug, and test.  Time permitting, change the debug data around to confirm that it still works.\n\nThe last step is to swap out debugCreateTestData() with randomize() again.  Test to confirm that it works, and we are done.\n\nMin 105-110)\n\nAnswer questions.\n\n(Min 110 - 120)\n\nWhat should the class do with project time?\n\nReview the readme, because whenever we are unsure of what to do next, this is where we look - specs/docs/etc. \n\nWe have phase 5 and 6 left, except for students who have already completed it earlier.  The remaining project time should be used to complete those phases, then work on the stretch to add weights to the project and implement Djikstra.\n\n\n",

   "Instructor Notes": "\n**All solution for the week’s projects can be found here:**\nhttps://codepen.io/collection/a5e1a882bd176d62b733f3b9d14a8886/\n\n**Sprint Challenge Solution:** https://codepen.io/lambdaschool/project/editor/98fb6fda80dcef7c46d59b1ec5de1ecf\n\n\nSuggested instruction flow for Day 1 of RWD:\n* What is responsive design / development? \n    * Use a good example like thegoodline.com \n    * Explain that mobile devices are gaining ground and surpassing desktop usage by going to https://www.netmarketshare.com/ and navigating to Devices > Types and showing the desktop and mobile percentages.\n* So how do we start getting to a responsive layout?  Viewport links and examples would be super nice.  Using a device emulator to show case how things look without a viewport.  Good examples and non-examples would be great here.  \n    * https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Viewport\n* Go from viewport to actual code examples that start with max and min width.  Explain that max is width and down and min is width and up.\n    * https://codepen.io/lambdaschool/pen/JLmWPb?editors=1100\n* Introduce media queries and explain how they are important.\n    * https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/@media\n* Give code examples of media queries and ask the students to update the 3 boxes based on media queries\n    * https://codepen.io/lambdaschool/pen/eMPpZx\n* Move into what mobile first and desktop first approaches look like.  Have examples and non-examples ready\n    * A good example of mobile first is https://getbootstrap.com/\n* Show the project design material and address the mobile navigation.\n    * https://github.com/LambdaSchool/Responsive-Web-Design",

This is paramount to future success of the students.\n\nUsual order concepts are taught:\n\n* Quick overview of yesterday's fundamentals\n* Introduction to chrome dev tools\n* Box model: content, padding, border, and margin\n* box-sizing: border-box.  This is a tough concept, be sure to showcase how padding adds to the total width and expands elements where box-sizing pushes in from the border.\n* Shorthand properties of box model.  Top Right Bottom Left === \"TRBL.\"  I will often say \"You will be in TRBL if you forget the shorthand order!\"\n* Display types: none, block, inline, inline-block, brief mention of flexbox for tomorrow but don't cover it today.\n* Positioning: static, relative, absolute, fixed\n* HUGE concept with positioning absolute or fixed is the parent must have relative assigned or it will try to match the window's position.\n* z-index explained in combination with position fixed/absolute\n",

   "Instructor Notes": "Make sure all project dependencies are up to date. Clone the project to a new folder and install all dependencies to make sure there are no errors.\n\n* _Progress without understanding is just moving forward in a random direction._\n* I always like to start off Testing week with a discussion on \"how\" software gets built. I end up spending more time than I probably ought to fleshing out for the students the different examples of dev teams that I've been a part of.\n* This commonly leads to a discussion about `project/feature planning`. I love giving the following story to the students as piece of advice.\n\nWhile at Nokē our software team was constantly working under the gun. We had a product, that many big important companies were beta testing. Our software was unique in that it was an application that interfaced with hardware. As goes the story with many start ups, our CEO was running around trying to land certain investments and projects to keep us a float while we were able to show off to investors how effectively our team was able to perform.\n\nWe ended up building a prototype lock that could be installed to work with a storage unit, and of course, we needed an app to deliver along with it. Because the hardware was so drastically different we had to approach this as a nearly brand new app, not just a skin/clone of our previous system. Our deadline? 3 weeks!\n\nWith a tight deadline, and a CEO out in Georgia on business, (leaving us to our own devises) our dev team did what we do best, we planned. Three business days of planning and writing tests, and boiler-plating, and white boarding, and arguing/discussing we came up with a battle plan. We knew how fast we could work as a team, dividing our expectations and tasks up into different portions of work and finally, began writing real code.\n\nWe not only ended up shipping the app on time (and it wasn't trivial), but we got MVP a few days early which gave us time to flesh out bugs + add on features we didn't think we'd be touching. The moral of the story here is that planning out your understanding of the problem at hand, and breaking down the work will help you immensely as a developer. As I got to my desk on Thursday morning of Week 1, I had the majority my tests written for what my code should look like, how it should perform and what any expected/anticipated behaviors we might encounter. Of course not everything accounted for. But It allowed me to move forward confident, and build rapidly each feature that needed to be a part of the project.",

You need to make sure your PMs are hounding the students for project requirements all week long.\n\nThis spreadsheet is super helpful in tracking progress throughout the week.

The format can be however you like it but an effective way is to break down the days like this:\n\nDay 1: Trello board and initial pull request committed for PM to review.\n\nDay 2: MVP could be complete by several students at this stage but the general expectation is that most students will be finished with 1 to 2 features.\n\nDay 3: Students should be near completion of the MVP. \n\nDay 4: MVP should be complete and new features being looked at\n\nDay 5: MVP completed, some features added, and a demo afternoon is used to showcase work.  We used 2pm PST as the deadline for the MVP project.\n\nDemo Format:\nSome groups will be larger than others, if your project managers have a larger group, encourage them to reduce the time to just 2 minutes.  It's very important that every student demos even if they aren't 100% complete.  \n\nCohort Wide:\n* 2 demos per group\n* 2 minute demos showcasing their features\n\nGroup Wide:\n* Everyone demos 2 mins max with a 3 minute Q&A\n* Prepare to talk briefly talk about what was most challenging\n* Prepare to talk briefly talk about what was most rewarding\n\nNOTE: Finishing the MVP is not as important as the learning behind it.  Stress this with your group of project managers and students.  If you feel a student is completely over their head after the week is over, report progress to our Director of Student Success.\n\n\nHere is the color scheme /fonts for the students: \n\n```md\nHeading font: Roboto Bold\nEverything else font: Raleway Medium\n\nHeading and main font color: #4A4A4A\nButton font color: #FFFFFF\n\nSidebar background: #D8D8D8\nMain background: #F3F3F3\nMain button background: #2BC1C4\nDelete button background: #D0021B\nBorder color used throughout: #979797\n```",

   "Name": "Getting started with Python and Django",
   "2 Days": "",
   "Description": "You've learned how to build back-ends with node.js, using the minimalist Express framework. Now you're going to get started with another language, another ecosystem, and another framework - Python and Django. Your first goal - get set up, learn a bit about the system, and be able to make a simple \"Hello Django\" application.\n\nPython is a pragmatic multiparadigm general purpose programming language with a healthy community and large ecosystem/package library, convenient for small to medium sized projects (and larger ones with proper discipline). Usually when people say \"Python\" they mean CPython 3, which is the reference implementation and what we will use, but other flavors exist as well (IronPython, Jython, PyPy, etc.). Django is, like Python, a pragmatic \"one right way to do it\" system, specifically a web application framework built on the principles of convention over configuration and fast iterative design. It is \"batteries included\", which means it comes with ways to do most common web application tasks (data models, ORM, templates, forms, validation, auth, etc.).\n\nThe Django ecosystem bills itself as \"the web framework for perfectionists with deadlines\" - these many included features are what makes it quick to build an MVP with. We will start by learning about and using these components, and then move on to extend the system and (to some extent) pick and choose the modules we actually want.\n\nFor now - get started by setting out on the objectives, setting up a Python/Django development environment and making a basic Django app. There are also many linked resources to check out for each objective, Django has an excellent community with lots of helpful tutorials and documentation.\n\nGood luck, and have fun getting started with Django!",
   "Instructor Notes": "This module encompasses day 1 of Python/Django I, and is meant to be a semi-freebie day material wise, focused on setup. The end result should be a PR to the \"Hello Django\" repo that shows students have successfully installed Python/Django and can start a project (but the project itself is just complete given boilerplate, except for the occasional student who digs into the tutorial and gose further).",

They are more specific than a paradigm (like OOP or functional programming), and can potentially be compatible with multiple paradigms (though many tend towards OOP). They are less specific than an algorithm - they don't solve a problem, rather they inform you how to design a solution to a problem.",
   "Instructor Notes": "This is for days 3-4 of Django, in the mornings live code the Bookmarks app and take it as far as reasonably possible with vanilla Django features (models, views, templates, forms). In the afternoons, encourage students to as an MVP reproduce the morning work, and as a stretch goal take it further/customize it. Also, apply a basic CSS style using django-bootstrap4, and encourage students to customize from there.\n\nThere are a ton of design patterns, and not all of them really \"caught on\" - the material focuses on factories, decorators, lazy initialization, and iterators as the most commonly seen in practice. MVC and ORM could also both be seen as design patterns, but are treated as separate modules, but can be foreshadowed a bit here if time allows.",

   "Name": "Object-relational mapping",
   "2 Days": "checked",
   "Description": "Traditional web applications tend to serve and consume REST APIs - noun-verb centered interactions with entities represented in a database. Rather than force developers to handcraft SQL queries for these interactions, most web application frameworks encourage the use of an object-relational mapping (ORM) that allows the developer to naturally use classes/objects that represent their data and builds/executes the appropriate queries for them.\n\nThere are many advantages to this approach, most notably abstraction from the specific underlying database (allowing you to swap them more easily) and protection from SQL injection and other security risks. The cost is it's difficult for an ORM to be as expressive and powerful as SQL, and it's possible to misuse an ORM to accidentally build really inefficient queries (granted it's also possible to misuse SQL in the same way). The Django ORM does a pretty good job of balancing usability and power, and with proper use can efficiently perform the vast majority of database interactions you are likely to need to do.",
   "Instructor Notes": "This is day 9 (second Thursday) of Django material, and is important for prepping them for the sprint challenge.

This week you'll be working on one single project. Today's focus for that project is to get your project off the ground, and show your PM that you have the ability to think about the Components you'll need for a larger project.

   "Description": "There are three ways to interpret data:\n\n#### 1. Numerical analysis.\n\nThe first and most classical way to interpret data is to enter all of the values into some equation, then solve the equation for the desired result. Linear systems of equations are one of the more common approaches, but even our ever familiar `y = f(x)` is an example of this approach.\n\nThis approach works well when the data is simple enough to work out  by hand, though there are automated matrix approaches to compute these solutions that work with linear and nonlinear regressions.\n\nConsider a dataset of local weather values:\n\n| baro press | date | time | yesterday high| \nprecip chance | temp\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | ---|\n| | | | | | |\n| 1.1 | 2018-01-01 | 12:00 | 34 | 15 | 39 |\n\nWith this data it is easy to create an equation to solve for the temperature given any other dataset (though the equation isn't likely to be correct)\n\n<img src=\"https://www.dropbox.com/s/hogy1q2nyxd9hj1/Data_Visualization-NumericalAnalysis.gif?raw=1\" alt=\"1.1a + b + 12c + 34d + 15e = f\">\n\nThis approach works well for small datasets and can produce some information about the data, but becomes immediately unwieldy when the data is large.\n\n#### 2. Machine learning model\n\nInstead of computing the result of the above equation directly, models have been designed to provide an answer without requiring the mathematician to solve the above equation. We will be studying these models, their implementation, and their usefulness over the rest of this course.\n\n#### 3. Visualization\n\nGetting good results with Machine Learning means choosing the right model for the job. Before you as an ML engineer can choose the right tool, you need to learn how to visualize your data.\n\nIn this section, you're going to learn how to visualize data in the three most popular mathematical programming environments: numpy, R, and matlab/octave.\n\n<a href=\"https://matplotlib.org/mpl_toolkits/mplot3d/tutorial.html\">Many great 3D plots and their code samples in matplotlib</a>",

Neurons are more or less receptive to different parts of the input, depending on the transformation (convolution) that is applied.\n\nThe resulting models are extremely effective at image recognition and classification problems, requiring little data pre-processing and exhibiting results competitive with (or better than!) humans. They can also be applied to other areas, including content-based recommender systems, video recognition, and NLP tagging/predictions.",

This is very hard problem.\n\nComputer Vision components:\n* Iteration\n* Convolution\n* Scale space\n* Feature Vectors\n* Mapping\n\nFundamentally, Computer Vision is iterating over a stored image as a 2d or 1d array and performing convolutions as you iterate, storing results and capturing mathematical details and structure.\n\nToday, the most powerful CV technique is the Deep Convolutional Neural Net, a departure from the above canon. However, learning the fundamentals will enable much better understanding and implementation of even Deep networks.",

   "2 Days": "",
   "Description": "Sentiment Analysis which focuses on analyzing sentiment of various text resources ranging from corporate feedback surveys to movie reviews is probably the most popular application of text analytics. The main aspect of sentiment analysis is to analyze a body of text in order to decipher the opinion expressed by it including factors like emotion, feelings and mood. \n\nSentiment Analysis works best on text that has a subjective context rather than an objective context. When a body of text has an objective perspective, it usually reflects real factual statements with no emotion or feelings associated with it. In contrast, subjective text includes opinions encompassing emotions and feelings that are expressed by humans. Given the proliferation of social media channels, Sentiment Analysis is increasingly being leveraged by a host of entities (be it a business, a public sector organization, government, etc.) to extract the subjective and opinion related information like emotions, attitude, mood and use the extracted subjective information to the detect the sentiment of people.\n\nSentiment analysis can be defined as a classification problem in which the classification is either —binary classification (positive or negative) and multi-class classification (positive, negative, or neutral). \n\nIn this module, we will explore a range of related topics encompassing 1) Constructing a Sentiment Analysis Model, 2) Determining the subjectivity of text, 3) Examining the intensity or polarity of a sentiment and 4) Performing sentiment analysis on tweets. As we step through the topics, each subsequent topic will build on the previous one. We will start off with text classification for sentiment analysis.",

The first technique that we will examine is Part-Of-Speech tagging (POS) which is used to label words in a sentence as nouns, pronouns, adjectives, verbs, etc. Following that, we will explore the concept of \"Dependency Parsing\" which parses a body of text to uncover chunks of meaning and relations. Then, we will look at how to find the \"head\" of a sentence which denotes the most important word in the sentence. Finally, we will review the topic of \"Named Entity Recognition\" which helps in finding named entities within sentences such as places, people, things, monetary figures, etc.",

We will hone in on the following 2 topics:\n\n1) Explore the spread or variability (i.e. standard deviation) of the numbers in the data set\n2) Compute the “Z-Score” i.e. how many standard deviations do the data points lie from the mean\n\nWe will build on the concepts learned in this session in the subsequent sessions within this module.\n\n\n\n \n",

   "Description": "The most basic definition of probability is what is the likelihood that an event will take place. For example: What is the chance that it will rain tomorrow? What is the chance that I will get 2 3's on the next roll of the dice? What is the probability that the Golden State Warriors will win the NBA championship in 2018? Probability is usually depicted as a \"ratio\" or a \"percent\" and is computed by dividing the desired outcome by the total # of possible outcomes. \n\nA key point to note is that the probability of all possible outcomes will sum to 100%. To illustrate this point, let's look at an example: When you toss a coin, you can can either a heads or a tails. What is the probability of getting a heads? It is 1 (desired outcome) divided by 2 (# of possible outcomes). There is a 50% chance you will gets a heads and there is a 50% chance you will get tails. The sum of all possible outcomes is 100%.\n\nIn this session, we will cover the following range of topics:\n1) Probability of multiple events (including Bayes Theorem)\n2) Model continuous random variables with a Probability Density Function",

   "Name": "Sampling, Confidence Intervals and Hypothesis Testing",
   "2 Days": "",
   "Description": "In this module, we will cover *sampling* and other key topics related to sampling such as *confidence intervals* and *hypothesis testing*. Sampling is a process that is related to the selection of individual observations; it helps us make statistical inferences about the population. Accumulating all the information about the population (a census) is time consuming and expensive. Therefore, sampling is performed to make inferences about the population. In sampling, we assume that samples are drawn from the population and sample means and population means are equal. \n\nGiven that a sample is a group of individual observations drawn from a population, the # of individual units or observations that constitute a sample is known as the sample size. Since the intent of the sample is to provide a representative picture of the entire population, the larger the sample size, the more accurate is the measurement and the more confidence we have that the sample is actually representative of the whole population. \n\nWe will delve further into sampling and sample sizes which will help us grasp the topic: What is the standard error of a sample? Let's say we have a distribution of continuous random variables. From the distribution, we take a sample of 10 observations and plot the average of the 10 observations.\n\nWe repeat this exercise several times, on each occasion we gather a sample of 10 observations from the distribution and plot the average of the 10 observations. As we keep repeating this exercise, the sampling distribution of the sample mean will represent a normal distribution.\n\nIf we were to repeat the entire exercise with larger sample sizes, the curve would become narrower, taller and the standard deviation would be tighter. You will notice that with larger sample sizes, the sample mean will approach the population mean. The Standard Error (SE) tells you how far your sample mean deviates from the population mean.\n\nRemember, the larger your sample size, the closer your sample mean is to the actual population mean. Note that the Standard Error is very similar to the Standard Deviation. Both are measures of spread. The higher the number, the more spread out your data is.\n\nHowever, there is a key difference between the Standard Error and Standard Deviation. The standard error uses statistics (i.e. sample data) whereas the standard deviation uses population data. The standard deviation of the sampling distribution of the sample mean is also called the standard error of the mean and is computed as follows: sd of sampling distribution of sample mean/square of n (i.e. sample size).",

In this module, we will leverage the \"Chi-square\" technique to compare 2 or more populations.

It can be numeric, in the the form of paragraphs of text, and even in picture form such as charts, graphs and maps. Given that data comes in many forms, it is important to prepare the data before it can be used to train your Machine Learning algorithms.\n\nData preparation involves a range of activities from 1) joining two or more data sets together to 2) reducing data sets to only a select group of variables to 3) cleansing data to eliminate anomalies such as outlier observations or missing data to 4) re-formatting data for consistency purposes.\n\nThe more disciplined you are in preparing your data, the more consistent and better results you are like likely to achieve from your Machine Learning algorithms. The process for getting data ready for training a machine learning algorithm revolves around 3 key steps:\n\n1. Selecting the data\n2.

   "Name": "Data Structures",
   "2 Days": "checked",
   "Description": "Up through this point, as you have been working through the Web curriculum, even though data structures were never officially introduced, you were making extensive use of them all the time. Python lists and dictionaries are so useful and versatile that they were included as standard in the language. \n\nIndeed, data structures are extremely prevalent and fundamental when it comes to understanding programming and computer science. By the end of the Computer Science curriculum, you'll have a good idea of the answers to important questions that were raised during the web curriculum such as 'how do web servers such as Express effectively and efficiently handle hundreds or thousands of concurrent requests simultaneously?' or 'how does a database like MongoDB organize the data that it stores in such a way that it can then retrieve it as quickly as possible?'. Such questions can be answered in part by having an understanding of both the wide berth of all the currently-existing data structures that have been dreamt as well as an adequately deep understanding of how many common data structures work.  \n\nAs part of your first Data Structures sprint, we'll be learning about and implementing some very common and fundamental data structures that are very often used to implement more complex and specialized data structures. These are the:\n \n - Linked List\n - Queue\n - Binary Search Tree\n - Heap\n\nEach of these data structures has its own associated strengths and weaknesses. Think of each of them as a tool in a toolbox. You have entirely different classes of tools such as hammers and wrenches that are each used for entirely different use cases. You also have multiple types of screwdrivers. Both are used for tightening and untightening screws, but the Phillips screwdriver is better for certain screws and the flathead screwdriver is better for other types of screws. \n\nThe same can be said of data structures. There are many instances of wildly different data structures that serve entirely different use cases, and then you have data structures that _can_ both perform the same function, but one will be better at it than the other.  More specifically, you _could_ emulate the functionality of a JavaScript Array using an Object, but an Object isn't going to perform as efficiently when it comes to certain tasks that Arrays are really efficient at. \n\n## A Note About Data Structures in Different Language Contexts\nLet's go back to the topic of linked lists seeming redundant in Python. Why do we need to learn about linked lists when Python already provides for us such a full-featured array implementation (via lists) that can already do everything a linked list can do? Sure, linked lists have marginally better performance on certain operations when compared to arrays, but does that really justify the existence of the linked list data structure? \n\nThese are all entirely valid points; working in Python _does_ obviate the need to implement certain data structures such as linked lists and hash tables. This brings us to a core tenet of the Computer Science curriculum: the material that you'll be exposed to and learning about in the Computer Science curriculum will be almost entirely language-agnostic. Seasoned developers and programmers learn to sever the connection between coming up with a solution to a problem they're facing, and actually implementing that solution. That probably doesn't mean a lot right now, but as you go on to expand your knowledge horizons by learning about other programming languages such as C, you'll come to realize that different languages place different constraints on the programmer. Notably, in C, there is no full-featured array implementation. There's also no built-in hash table. Thus, you'll find that when it comes time to work in C, knowing how to implement data structures that seem obsolete in Python will have a payoff.\n\n## Additional Resources\n\n1. https://www.interviewcake.com/article/python/data-structures-coding-interview?course=dsa does a great job of motivating and introducing most of the data structures we cover in this sprint. \n\n2.

Students will be split in to small teams and assigned a project to work on and a PM to work with. \n\nEach team will start the week with a Trello board full of tasks to complete, wireframes, and a design document. This experience will look and feel like a job at a real world dev shop. \n\nStudents will start each day with a stand up meeting, led by their PM, they’ll have sprint objectives to complete, participate in code reviews and pair programming, and have a client to impress. \n\nWe also focus heavily on “Job Interview Preparation” during Lambda Labs so students will participate in mock interviews and whiteboard interview practice sessions as well as workshops lead by our Career Services team. The Career Services curriculum is documented in a separate Sprint.\n\nThe Labs experience culminates with a Capstone Defense, where each student individually will present their capstone project to a panel of Lambda School instructors, staff, and outside hiring partners. This is the “Final Exam” of the program.",
   "Instructor Notes": "Before delivering the Lambda Labs Kickoff, you'll need to have completed the following:\n\n* Ensured you have proper Project Manager staffing\n* Project Descriptions\n* Project Trello boards\n* Themeforest theme for each project\n* Business requirements spec for each project\n\nYou'll also need to have completed the Project Draft. To do so, do the following:\n\n* Send out a job application-like form to incoming students to get a feel for personality, fit, interest, etc. (including asking who they might want to work with, and who they definitely would not want to work with)\n* Invite the Project Managers who've been working with the students, and the instructor who most recently worked with them\n* Create a spreadsheet with a projects column and spaces for each of the students\n* Divide the students to create equitable teams, dividing up students who will need more attention, and the all-stars\n\nHere's an example of a message you might send to incoming students before this module:\n\n> (Insert Ryan's cool message here.)",

   "Description": "In the first sprint, students will focus on building a team and getting a strong start to their project.",
   "Instructor Notes": "This sprint is critical for getting all of the teams off to a strong start.  There are a few major risks that are commonly present in the first sprint:\n\n* Cowboys trampling over their teams:  Often the strongest coders will completely ignore the process and their teams and simply start doing a large amount of work without talking to anyone or pulling tasks.  Strong adherence to the standup reporting process will mitigate this on the first or second day.  It is critical that the PMs are aware of what everyone is actually working on.\n\n* Pre-production hell:  When faced with an intimidating array of new tasks, some teams will get bogged down in \"research\".  They will want to try out different APIs, explore deployment platforms, and do many other things that feel like work but don't really result in tasks getting done.  This is not the focus of the first sprint, except for consideration of deployment platforms.  Ensure that the teams are not researching feature-related items and keep them focused on standing up the servers and database.  Encourage them to make decisions after a short conversation, rather than a lengthy evaluation of options. It is almost always better to just try it and change things if they don't work.  ",

You start your Lambda journey by diving into your personal tool suite and learning how Xcode supports your application development. You'll tour the app, learn to identify and control the various panes and editors, and write a simple working app on your very first day.\n\nYou'll also review version control. Version control helps you manage project source code and collaborate with others. You'll use this knowledge to participate in Lambda's projects and submit your work to your project managers.  Lambda School uses git, which is the most widely used version control system across iOS development. Version control tracks changes in computer files and coordinates work on those files among multiple people. It is an essential tool for iOS developers, and one you will work with every day. ",

   "2 Days": "",
   "Description": "So far, we've worked with types that Swift gives us, including `Int`, `Double`, `String`, `Array`, and `Dictionary`. One of the most powerful things about Swift is that it gives you the ability to define your own types that best fit the problems you're trying to solve. In this lesson, we'll cover two kinds of custom types in Swift: structs, and classes. you'll learn how to create your own custom types using these two features of Swift.",
   "Instructor Notes": "This is a first introduction to classes and structs in Swift. We can't cover everything there is to know about both in an hour lecture, so set the students up to feel comfortable using the most commonly used basics of each. Deeper topics like convenience and failable initializers, protocol conformance, use cases for subclassing, static properties, etc. will be covered later.",

There are many ways to layout a page in CSS but flexbox is one of the most powerful and simple ways to do it.  We will discuss the basics of what flexbox is and how we use it properly to build a user interface.   ",
   "Instructor Notes": "This is a concept that covers a full guided demo.  I prefer to use the most popular online guide to flexbox:  https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/\n\nLast time I taught this:\n\nhttps://codepen.io/lambdaschool/pen/bmEyNb?editors=1100\n\nIMPORTANT:  It is of major importance to describe that flexbox is a module with many parts and rules.  Example: \n\n\ndisplay: none; does one thing!\n\ndisplay: flex; enables a whole module of properties.  Make sure this is clearly understood.  Otherwise, students think display: flex; is just a single property and don't everything else as smooth.\n\nIMPORTANT: Make sure students know that there is a flex container and flex items within that container and each concept have its own properties.  This concept seems to escape many new learners.  Repeat this and showcase this in the guided demo many times.  \n\nTEACHING TIP: Focus on describing the two main axes of a flex container and how flexbox is one directional.  The faster students can understand that there is a main and cross axis the better.\n\nA good tip is that any flexbox property with \"align\" in its name is automatically assumed to be manipulating the cross axis.  Where a flexbox property with \"justify\" is on the main axis.",

Have the students come up with the things it can do and the things it has. Turn the former into methods, and the latter into member variables.\n\nThe idea here is to get them used to making a class for a thing that's not a physical object, but is more of a virtual idea.\n\n#### Project\n\nContinue working on the adventure game:\n* Add multiple item types which inherit from Item class\n* Add scoring for treasure items\n* Create LightSource items and dark rooms\n* Stretch goals!",

Animation supports UI design by allowing smooth transitions between one visual state and another.\n\nAnimations shouldn't draw attention to themselves. Flashy animations work against deferential design. Animations should be small, supportive, and seemingly effortless. Animation serves the interface and should not be the focal point of any GUI.\n\nBecause they are so fundamental to the user experience, animation technology exists in many forms and at many levels in the system APIs provided by Apple. Older APIs are more configurable. They provide powerful access to realizing any raw animation you can imagine. Newer APIs are more focused. They offer pre-built hooks to create a uniform user experience across devices.\n\nToday, you're going to build a basic framework for visualizing animations and then explore both some animation theory and the UIKit technologies that realize that theory.",

You can verify that your functions actually return the correct results for a given set of arguments. You can ensure that your classes behave correctly in various situations. When you write a good set of unit tests, you can be more confident that your code works the way it's supposed to. Updating, extending, and refactoring code runs the risk of introducing new bugs. Unit tests help significantly reduce this risk. In this lesson, you'll learn how to use Xcode's tools to add unit tests to your project, how to write basic unit tests, and how to run them to ensure that your code works correctly.",

   "Description": "Over the years, as programmers have solved similar problems over and over, we as a community have come up with common templates or rules of thumb for solving some of those problems. These templates are called _design patterns_. Design patterns aren't dogmatic sets of rules that you must _always_ follow. Rather, they're a toolbox full of ideas that will help you make sense of and structure your code so that it's good. That is, so that it's understandable, readable, maintainable, debuggable, extensible, performant, and reliable.\n\nIn this module, you'll learn a few of the most common and useful design patterns used when developing iOS apps.",

Now you’re going to continue building your Python proficiency and get started with another framework - Django. Your first goal - get set up, learn a bit about the system, and be able to make a simple “Hello Django” application.\n\nDjango is, like Python, a pragmatic “one right way to do it” system, specifically a web application framework built on the principles of convention over configuration and fast iterative design. It is “batteries included”, which means it comes with ways to do most common web application tasks (data models, ORM, templates, forms, validation, auth, etc.).\n\nThe Django ecosystem bills itself as “the web framework for perfectionists with deadlines” - these many included features are what makes it quick to build an MVP with. We will start by learning about and using these components, and then move on to extend the system and (to some extent) pick and choose the modules we actually want.\n\nFor now, get started by setting out on the objectives, setting up a Python/Django development environment and making a basic Django app. There are also many linked resources to check out for each objective, Django has an excellent community with lots of helpful tutorials and documentation.\n\nHave fun getting started with Django!",

   "Description": "Traditional web applications tend to serve and consume REST APIs - noun-verb centered interactions with entities represented in a database. Rather than force developers to handcraft SQL queries for these interactions, most web application frameworks encourage the use of an object-relational mapping (ORM) that allows the developer to naturally use classes/objects that represent their data and builds/executes the appropriate queries for them.\n\nThere are many advantages to this approach, most notably abstraction from the specific underlying database (allowing you to swap them more easily) and protection from SQL injection and other security risks. The cost is it’s difficult for an ORM to be as expressive and powerful as SQL, and it’s possible to misuse an ORM to accidentally build really inefficient queries (granted it’s also possible to misuse SQL in the same way). The Django ORM does a pretty good job of balancing usability and power, and with proper use can efficiently perform the vast majority of database interactions you are likely to need to do.",

   "2 Days": "",
   "Description": "\"Works on my machine\" is a common state of code developed by people lacking in software engineering background. For code (and science) to really work, it must be *reproducible*.\n\nWe've already learned about `pipenv` as a Python packaging tool, which goes a long way towards giving reproducible builds - but for even greater reproducibility (and deployability), *containers* are the tool of choice. A container is a minimal virtual operating system, complete with all the software needed to run the desired application. Because they pack everything together, they are truly *identical* to run regardless of host.\n\nDocker is a common standard and tool for containers, and we will use it to build and run Linux containers with Python code.",
   "Instructor Notes": "Getting Docker working is non-trivial, *especially* on Windows. The short of it - unless you have \"Windows Professional\" (or whatever comparable edition which includes virtualization support), Docker installation requires also fussing with VirtualBox to install Linux and be able to actually run containers. (MacOS \"just works\", as does Linux.)\n\nBaseline/fallback for people with local issues: https://training.play-with-docker.com/\n\n\nRegister a hub.docker.com account, and you can step through a series of tutorials that let you actually start/run containers in the browser.\n\nIllustrative image: https://image.itmedia.co.jp/news/articles/1406/10/yu_docker1.jpg",

   "Description": "This week you will be building an application of your own choosing. You are to treat this week as if you are building this application at a company and the instructor is your client. The project managers (including section lead) will be your main support throughout the week.\n\n\nThe main objective of this week is to develop the MVP features of your application. There are a few requirements that you should do before starting this project:\n\n- You must present your idea to your instructor and have them approve it. This idea can be anything you want, taking into account you will have from Monday through half of Thursday to work on it. Try to keep it feasible given the length of time you have!\n- A solid project plan/research. More details on this below.\n\n\n## Project Research and Planning\n\nA vital part of any project is planning and research, and writing an application is no exception. This is especially true of a project that you have a deadline for, such as this one and any project you work on at your future job. \n\nFailure to do proper research can result in a significantly shorter amount of time spent working on your application. You may not be a much of a \"planner\", however being able to research and plan out any project including this one is extremely beneficial. We've been able to see hundreds of students build projects with similar time constraints to this one; the end result between a well-planned project and a poorly or not planned project is often staggering.\n\nOnce you know what kind of project you want to write, take time to do a bit of research. In order to facilitate this process, use the project planner [found here](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/16965587/51573635-6c5cda00-1e67-11e9-93c8-66e73b034456.png). Please watch the video on how to effectively use this project planner as well.\n\nIn the past, students have wanted to use APIs that they had to email the maintainer for an API key instead of getting one immediately upon signing up to use the API. When researching APIs to use and come across one like this be wary. If you email them even over the weekend before this project week, there is no guarantee that they will respond. Consider finding another API that has similar information/functionality before resorting to using one like that.\n\nThis principle applies to anything you aren't absolutely sure about. Doing the research **before** you even make an Xcode project and realize that something won't work the way you thought it would is going to save you time and frustration.\n\nProject planning will provide you with a good roadmap to know how long you have to work on each feature and have a **solid** idea of what needs to be done before diving head-first into the project.",

   "Description": "Unit testing allows you to write code that tests to make sure that your application code works properly. You can verify that your functions actually return the correct results for a given set of arguments. You can ensure that your classes behave correctly in various situations. When you write a good set of unit tests, you can be more confident that your code works the way it's supposed to. Updating, extending, and refactoring code runs the risk of introducing new bugs. Unit tests help significantly reduce this risk. In this lesson, you'll learn how to use Android Studio's tools to add unit tests to your project, how to write basic unit tests, and how to run them to ensure that your code works correctly.",

   "Description": "Welcome to Lambda School! This module will cover some key points about jumping into a Lambda School program. We'll help you feel at home and ready to conquer the world.\n\nThis course will also help you think like a UX designer, re-introducing you to usability heuristics and cognitive psychological principles that can help you recognize and diagnose usability issues. We'll set the foundation here to build your UX skills.",
   "Instructor Notes": "Take about 15-20 minutes to introduce them to a Lambda experience.\n\nDay one will shape the students’ experience with Lambda School. First impressions make a big difference on attitude and attitude determines success. *Make this class fun and engaging.* Play interactive games with students to help them get to know each other. \n\nEstablish high expectations for course.\n\nHelp the students recognize the power of a Lambda education. It’s a different educational mind-set–jumping into Lambda School can be a bit of a shock. Our objective is to help students see the value of taking ownership of their own learning and facilitating that growth. \n\nGo over tips for using Slack\n\n-Red question mark for questions\n-Use threads—Keep channel clean\n-Have students ask questions right when they have them\n-Don’t use @channel\n\nIntroduce yourself—Who are you?\n(Consider using your LinkedIn profile to introduce yourself)\n\nHelp students get over the jitters. Help them see there’s opportunity everywhere for those who work hard.\n\nHelp them recognize that if they don't understand something about UX it's not because they're not SMART—throw that word out. Help them understand that familiarity is what we're looking for instead of smart. We’re not dumb, we’re unfamiliar. When you become familiar, you seem smart.\n\nTalk about using the \"Show it off\" rather than the course channel. In the course channel, we're quietly confident about our skills rather than being braggarts. We're supportive and positive. In channel let’s not talk about how easy assignments are. Different students struggle at different things. “That was so easy,\" shouldn't be something they see in the course channel.\n\nIf they want praise, have them direct message their instructor or PM. As an instructional team, we'll gush over you—or critique you harshly—whichever will help you become a better designer.\n\nAlso, we don’t put up with cyberbullying. Jokes or banter about gender differences, relationships, or sexuality should not take place in our channel or in any channel at Lambda. Religion or politics  should be avoided unless in a channel set up specifically for those types of conversations. But, in all things, we must be respectful of one another.\n\nTalk about learn.lambdaschool.com. Show it and explain what students can find there.\n\nTalk to students about how you expect your class to function. How you want to communicate to them and them to you. Let them know that sometimes you just want them to listen, sometimes you want them working along with you.\n\nYou'll also want them to start looking for a UX manager to contact to try to set up a time to meet or get on a call this week by Friday. That's a big part of our Sprint Challenge.",

   "Instructor Notes": "Guided projects repo: https://github.com/LambdaSchool/C-Web-Server-Guided-Projects/tree/master/echo\n\nSome possible topics to talk about during live lecture:\n\n1. Walk the students through what happens when you type a URL into a browser. Here, we won't take caching into account, as that will be talked about in Web Server II. Steps are outlined below:\n\n```\n1. Browser asks OS for server's IP address.\n2. OS makes a DNS lookup and replies to the browser with the requested IP address.\n3. Browser opens a connection to the server (we'll assume a TCP connection in this case). This step is much more complex with HTTPS. \n4. Browser sends the HTTP request through TCP connection.\n5. Browser receives HTTP response and may close the TCP connection, or reuse it for another request.\n6. Browser checks if the response is a redirect or a conditional response (3xx result status codes), authorization request (401), error (4xx and 5xx), etc.; these are handled differently from normal responses (2xx).\n7. Browser decodes response (e.g. if it's gzipped).\n8. Browser uses the MIME-type of the response to determine what to do with it (e.g. is it a HTML page, is it an image, is it a sound clip?).\n9. Browser renders response content, or offers a download dialog for unrecognized types.\n```\n\n2. Talk about how the internet works more generally. Possible topics include routing, DNS resolution, CDNs, etc. \nhttp://www.theshulers.com/whitepapers/internet_whitepaper/index.html\n\n3. Walk through the algorithm for how to construct a minimal spanning tree of a network.",

Dive more deeply into doubly linked lists. Live code a simple one in C so students gets a bit more comfortable working with one.\n\n2. Walk through an LRU cache implementation in Python to give the students a better idea of how one works: https://github.com/LambdaSchool/Data-Structures/tree/extras/lru_cache\n\n3. Explore the topic of caching strategies more in-depth. Talk a bit more at length about different caching strategies and what their pros and cons are. The goal here is certainly not to have students memorize these caching strategies, but more to raise their awareness of different caching patterns, and more importantly, to get them to analyze the benefits and tradeoffs of different caching strategies and think about use-cases when one is more appropriate than another. https://codeahoy.com/2017/08/11/caching-strategies-and-how-to-choose-the-right-one/\n\n4. Talk about how consistent hashing is architected for a multi-server environment, why it is useful, how it improves performance, etc.: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaRkONvyGr8\n\n5. Talk about load balancing\n",

   "Description": "Stakeholder interviews help set the boundaries of the design project. They are an excellent time to gather and learn about the assumptions being made in regard to the user experience.\n\nRecruiting users is a key part of the research process. Being able to effectively find people to participate as research subjects is a useful skill to have. For a UX designer, the ability to reach out to potential or existing customers will pay off in the quality of products she or he is able to design.\n\nEvery product has a target audience. Every website is intended to reach a certain type of people. The temptation is to say something like: “Everyone needs this product!” But, not everyone is going to want or need your product. In fact, no matter what product you build, you will be excluding a vast majority of earth’s inhabitants who won’t have any interest in it or will not be able to access it. When doing research you want to hear from the people who are among the target audience, not the excluded billions. Following effective recruiting processes can help avoid designing for the wrong audience.",

   "Description": "A user experience designer will often have to make presentations about the research they do during the discovery phase of a product design cycle. The effectiveness of their presentation often has a direct impact on how smoothly a project goes. Effectively explaining research findings and the implications of those findings lay a foundation upon which all other design decisions can build. When findings are accurate and explained well, design decisions that are based on the research will find welcome recipients among team members and stakeholders. Well-presented findings grease the wheels of the whole design process.",

By meeting the user in the field, you can learn more about things like your product’s competitors (whether another product or some other “real-world phenomenon”). You also have fewer intervening variables and can see what people _actually_ do rather than just what they _say_ they do or what they _think_ they do.",

It is designed to expose you to the routines present in most software development environments and give you the opportunity to practice them to the point where you will go into your first job feeling comfortable and ready to contribute.    \n\nIn Labs, sprints and sprint challenges work differently than in other parts of the program.  Each sprint, you will have individual goals and team goals.  The individual goals represent skills that every developer must demonstrate to be successful in a work environment.  The team goals represent the milestones that must be achieved for the project to stay on track.  \n\nFor your sprint challenge, you will use the last day of a sprint to complete an entry in your Development Journal.  This is submitted via a link in your weekly retrospective.  \n\nYour PM will use the content in your Development Journal, and other sources, to evaluate you for this sprint challenge.  If at any point, you are concerned that you will be unable to meet one of the requirements, please contact your PM immediately so that you can work towards a resolution.  A student who misses more than one item in the checklist for a given sprint, or misses the same item in consecutive sprints may be subject to the corrective action plan.\n\nPMs will use this checklist when evaluating a student’s Sprint Challenge Submission.  For three stars, the student must complete every requirement in the checklist at an exceptional standard.  For two stars, the student must complete at least 3 of the 4 items at an adequate level.  \n\n* The student’s github contribution graph shows participation in line with their actual contributions and is similar to those of their teammates and they listed a minimum of four PRs and matching Trello tickets, including a minimum of one front end and one back end\n* The student summarized their weeks work adequately\n* The student adequately performed a detailed analysis of one of their tickets\n* The student adequately answered the weekly reflection question\n\nAdditionally, teams will be tasked with completing a project milestone.  If a team is unable to complete the milestone/learning objectives by the end-of-sprint check-in, they will be given the opportunity to take advantage of the Flex program.  ",

   "Name": "Design Thinking and Beyond",
   "2 Days": "",
   "Description": "When designing products and especially designing new features for existing products, it is easy to get stuck in a rut. Creativity can get stymied by the familiarity and repetitiveness of designing within specific constraints for a long time. Sometimes it’s also hard to decide whether a creative idea will be useful and worth pursuing. Design Thinking is a loose methodology that emerged from engineering and industrial design, starting in the 1960s. Over time some organizations have promoted Design Thinking as an almost branded tool for generating new solutions to problems. Businesses leaders have also subsumed the concept as a way to strengthen their own business creativity. The design firm IDEO is one organization that has popularized the term Design Thinking, teaching courses in Design Thinking and following Design Thinking processes in its contract work. The Stanford D.School also teaches Design Thinking as a foundational process for design. Some folks decry Design Thinking as just common sense and that it doesn’t deserve the attention paid to it, but as Design Thinking helps provide order and structure to a sometimes convoluted and meandering process, it’s worth exploring and understanding more.

As you know from earlier weeks, gathering and cleaning data is generally non-trivial, but it's even trickier when you want to use it to fairly and robustly test various hypotheses.\n\nIn this module we will consider this challenge - how do we design and run an experiment? We will generally focus on web applications as a domain, but these techniques can be applied to any number of products, and indeed scientific scenarios more broadly. There are particular challenges working in the \"real-world\" though, and we will highlight those.",
   "Instructor Notes": "Running this may be a little tricky, as ideally students should run an actual little experiment that splits visitors and gets different data.

   "Instructor Notes": "Sprint test checklist: https://library.gv.com/sprint-week-friday-7f66b4194137\n\nJake Knapp uses the story of the publisher, Nigel Newton, who finally published Harry Potter after the manuscript had been rejected by eight other publishers. He only published because he handed a 50-page manuscript sample to his 8-year-old daughter and she came down after reading it and pestered him to get more of the book. He realized he had a winner on his hands. The point of his story is that testing with real users makes a huge difference. We \"experts\" are not always the real judges of what's good.\n\nHere's an article about the original J.K. Rowling story:\n\nhttps://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/books/news/revealed-the-eight-year-old-girl-who-saved-harry-potter-296456.html \n\n```The story [publisher Nigel Newton] tells in a rare personal interview is almost as unlikely as one of Rowling's muggles-and-magic plots. Bloomsbury, the off-beat company named after the 1920s London literary set, was just about the last chance for Rowling to get the original Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone into print.\n\nHer agent, Christopher Little, called at Bloomsbury Publishing's cramped offices in Soho Square and gave Newton a sample to read. He took it home but, instead of settling down with it himself, handed it to Alice, then eight years old.\n\n\"She came down from her room an hour later glowing,\" Newton recalls, \"saying, 'Dad, this is so much better than anything else.' She nagged and nagged me in the following months, wanting to see what came next.\"\n\nNewton made out a cheque to Joanne Kathleen Rowling for just £2,500, which has since proved one of the wisest investments in publishing history.\n\n....\n\n\"It was very fortunate for us,\" said Newton. \"We'd only just started to publish children's books in June 1994. And we hit it lucky.\" He told The Independent on Sunday that \"eight others turned J K Rowling down; ie, the whole lot\".\n```",

Why are we starting with this algorithm? Because it involves high dimensional data, typically works well when combined with PCA, and will help tie together some of the intuition that we have been working towards building over the course of the week.\n\n3) Briefly discuss the No Free Lunch Principle (NFL) Which basically states that the more we optimize an algorithm for solving one specific kind of problem, the worse it gets at solving all other kinds of problems. This is highly pertinent to clustering algorithms, but the biggest takeaway from the NFL principle is that there is no single approach that is going to be the best for every circumstance. The tools you use have to be informed by the data that you're working with and the context of the problem that you're trying to solve. ",

In other words, $Ax = b$ doesn't have a unique solution $x$, and so traditional OLS approaches fail.\n\nRelatedly, overfitting can occur in situations where OLS technically \"works\", but the structure of what is being predicted relative to the overall dimensionality of the model is such that the model aligns too tightly with the points, and doesn't generalize or have predictive value.\n\nOne approach to mitigate these problems is regularization - adding information to the model, in order to make it more tractable. In particular, we will consider a common regularized model, ridge regression, which is based on [Tikhonov regularization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tikhonov_regularization).",
   "Instructor Notes": "Again good to use this to emphasize robust != regularized, that both matter and are different tools to \"make your model better.\" Also emphasize that we're just showing a few examples of tools of this sort, there are many other related techniques worth learning if people wish, but the general principles/interpretation should be similar.",

Training requires backpropagation, but the actual predictions are all generated in a single direction.\n\nRecurrent neural networks introduce a (directed) cycle - and this changes more than you may think. They can accept as input a sequence of potentially arbitrary length, and use their cyclic structure as a form of memory - this makes them particularly appropriate for series data such as natural language (written and spoken) as well as climate, finance, and many other topics.",

   "Description": "This week you will be building an application of your own choosing. You are to treat this week as if you are building this application at a company and the instructor is your client. The project managers (including section lead) will be your main support throughout the week.\n\n\nThe main objective of this week is to develop the MVP features of your application. There are a few requirements that you should do before starting this project:\n\n- You must present your idea to your instructor and have them approve it. This idea can be anything you want, taking into account you will have from Monday through half of Thursday to work on it. Try to keep it feasible given the length of time you have!\n- A solid project plan/research. More details on this below.\n\n\n## Project Research and Planning\n\nA vital part of any project is planning and research, and writing an application is no exception. This is especially true of a project that you have a deadline for, such as this one and any project you work on at your future job. \n\nFailure to do proper research can result in a significantly shorter amount of time spent working on your application. You may not be a much of a \"planner\", however being able to research and plan out any project including this one is extremely beneficial. We've been able to see hundreds of students build projects with similar time constraints to this one; the end result between a well-planned project and a poorly or not planned project is often staggering.\n\nOnce you know what kind of project you want to write, take time to do a bit of research. In order to facilitate this process, use the project planner [found here](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/16965587/51573635-6c5cda00-1e67-11e9-93c8-66e73b034456.png). Please watch the video on how to effectively use this project planner as well.\n\nIn the past, students have wanted to use APIs that they had to email the maintainer for an API key instead of getting one immediately upon signing up to use the API. When researching APIs to use and come across one like this be wary. If you email them even over the weekend before this project week, there is no guarantee that they will respond. Consider finding another API that has similar information/functionality before resorting to using one like that.\n\nThis principle applies to anything you aren't absolutely sure about. Doing the research **before** you even make an Android Studio project and realize that something won't work the way you thought it would is going to save you time and frustration.\n\nProject planning will provide you with a good roadmap to know how long you have to work on each feature and have a **solid** idea of what needs to be done before diving head-first into the project.",

   "Description": "When you're a software engineer, you're not just writing code for your own immediate needs - you're building a system that others will work on, from coworkers and open-source collaborators to future-you. To do this, we must write code based on shared principles of design and style.\n\nIn this module we will learn the basic principles of object-oriented programming, the most common paradigm for the design and building of large codebases. We will also learn about standard code style and tooling, and the code review process.",
   "Instructor Notes": "Use appropriate static code checking tools (Flake8, autopep8, yapf), integrated with an editor and git workflow, to enforce consistent pep8 styling on Python code.",

   "Description": "You've written your code using OOP, it runs and works, it's in a package, and you can even run it in a reproducible container. You're done, right?\n\nNope! To effectively share your code in a way that will be lastingly useful, you also need to *test* and *document*. These are not just \"overhead\" tasks - they are a core part of software engineering, and code that lacks these properties is essentially impossible to maintain or build on in the long term.\n\nLast but not least, you need to choose an appropriate license for your code, and make sure you understand the licenses of your dependencies and the ecosystem in general. You don't need a law degree, but there are big differences between licenses you should understand, even ones that all count as \"open source.\"",
   "Instructor Notes": "There's lots of testing tools out there - pytest is probably the most used in Python, but we'll use unittest because it's part of the standard library: https://docs.python.org/3.7/library/unittest.html\n\nAlso, the material focuses on teaching unit tests since they're the most tractable to get started with, but it's worth noting that obsessive coverage of a codebase with unit tests is generally less effective than fewer well-written integration and end-to-end (larger) tests. Unit tests in real codebases require lots of mocking and make lots of assumptions, and may not really test interactions/corner cases as much as integration tests.\n\nAlso, emphasize that unit tests are sometimes valuable not for the tests themselves but for them encouraging you to refactor your code into small units in the first place.",

For our purposes we will focus on PostgreSQL, but most of what we learn will be general.",

   "Description": "One of the fundamental details that separate UX/UI designers from other designers is that our medium is constantly shifting. Graphic designers can focus on the fixed size of a poster; print designers can be sure that paper sizes aren’t changing tomorrow; architects know that the building foundation won’t change, but our designs need to work across an incredible array of shapes and sizes - from tiny iWatches all the way up to digital billboards.\n\nFortunately, over the last 10 years or so, UX/UI designers have worked to solve this problem and have found ways to design for the infinite variety of screens. In this lesson, we’ll dive into this exciting world and learn how to embrace the shifting screens of our digital medium.",

The result - created content that at least eerily represents the input, regardless of structure and without any need for labels.\n\nGANs are lots of fun, and can make for cool portfolio pieces. It is worth noting that, as they are an unsupervised learning technique, there are generally fewer direct business applications (unless you're in the business of counterfeiting cats) - so, make sure to understand their limitations, and still know your foundations and more broadly useful models.",

It’s a common term to hear in the tech field now, but was actually coined by two psychologists, Pauline Clance and Suzanne Imes, in 1978. While it’s not a “syndrome” in the clinical sense, they called it this after observing academics and professionals with pervasive self-doubt, even despite plenty of external evidence of their accomplishments, skills, intelligence, and capability.**\n\n**While imposter syndrome might seem like an inconvenience or just a bad feeling, it can actually have a real impact on your career success; people who experience imposter syndrome may be less likely to be promoted, may have lower salaries, and may feel less overall job satisfaction. We do not want you to be held back by this after all your hard work to get to where you are, so today we’re going to review how to recognize imposter syndrome and overcome it.**",
