The JetBrains IntelliJ IDEA IDE and Maven are used to integrate services with a RDBMS using JPA and Hibernate while deploying those web services using Tomcat. Swagger is used for REST documentation; JUnit and RestAssured are used to Unit Testing and Test Driven Development (TDD). Using Java 11, students study both current best practices and legacy code with the goal of being comfortable working with Java 8+. The students also receive some exposure to message queueing using RabbitMQ, in-memory caching with Redis, and continuous deployment to the cloud. Overall the course is preparing students to be ready to integrate into current Java Spring Teams!\n\nThe work is hard but very rewarding and enjoyable! I hope you decide to join the class. If you have already joined, Welcome!!!
