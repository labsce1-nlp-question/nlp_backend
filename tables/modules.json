In this module we will give a short introduction to: \n- Vector transformations \n- Eigenvectors and Eigenvalues\n- The \"Curse of Dimensionality\"\n\nIf we can establish these topics sufficiently then we will have a great foundation for understanding Principal Component Analysis (PCA). PCA is a dimensionality reduction technique (feature extraction) that seeks to reduce the dimensions (columns) of a dataset while preserving the maximum amount of information (variance) possible. PCA is not an easy topic to wrap your head around, but we will demonstrate the steps for performing this technique using both numpy and sklearn and hopefully get you well on your way to \"grok-ing\" this popular and powerful dimensionality reduction technique.

So your notebook should have more than just code and exploratory visualizations. Instead, your goal is to tell an interesting story, with polished explanatory visualizations, like a FiveThirtyEight article.\n\nThis project is the first of multiple you\u2019ll make for your portfolio. Future projects will involve regression models, software engineering, and machine learning. The goal for this data storytelling project is to really \u201cstick the landing\u201d with polished presentation.\n\nFor your target audience, imagine a business manager who is data literate at reading basic reports but not at producing them, and who is busy with many responsibilities, one of which is reviewing a big stack of data science job applications. You want to grab this manager\u2019s attention with your well-designed visual and first few sentences.\n\nAt the beginning of Sprint 2, you learned how to find ideas and data for your project. At the end of Sprint 3, you wrote about your project: your hypothesis, first paragraph, sources, and next steps. So, you should already have chosen your idea and acquired your raw data. If not, please speak with your PM or an instructor.",

The two foundational pieces of knowledge the students need to understand are:\n* The nature of the chain - each block has a hash of the previous block, which is dependent on that block's hash of the its previous block, all the way back to the beginning.  This means that if any alteration is made to a block in the middle, it will break the chain because none of the hashes will be correct from that point forward.  \n* The nature of proof of work - because so much effort is required, and being made, to make the next block in the chain, it is essentially impossible for an attacker to alter a block and generate new hashes and blocks for the rest of the chain, because they would need the computing power to catch and exceed the rest of the miners in the world.  \n\nGP - Implement the basic_block_gp project.  \n\nEvening Project - Students should alter the `mine` endpoint to accept a potential solution and evaluate it, rather than doing the mining on the server, and write a program to do the mining.  \n\nDay 2:  Discuss the third pillar of the blockchain tripod - Distribution.  Explain how nodes are connected together and review the concept of consensus.  \nGP - Solution lecture for mining program and implementation of communication between nodes. \n\nEvening Project - Modify the mining program to send a hash id with the miner's unique identification, and to credit the coin to that id in the server.

            "Description": "Blockchain is a data structure that's useful for sharing a ledger of transactions that is universally agreed upon, but without the need for a central authority. It forms the basis for cryptocurrency, and is useful in a variety of different fields, including voting, contracts, and many others.\n\nThe core principle of blockchain is to shift from the systems we use today that are based on trust, to one that is instead based on proof.  \n\nTrust means that we accept the validity of information based on our trust in the organization that is shepherding that information.  The number in our bank account is trusted to be valid because we believe the institution of the bank will act according to the agreement that we have made with them.  We trust that they will not arbitrarily change the number in our account to zero and take all of our money away, because if they did so, people would stop using them and they would go out of business.  But as developers, we know that it is a trivial task to edit a database entry.  Most of our institutions are based on this trust.  Normally, this works fine, but there can be severe problems in times of unrest or corruption.\n\nThe concept of proof attempts to resolve this problem.  Rather than trusting an authority, transactions, which can be monetary, contracts, or really any type of data, are posted in a public ledger that is readily available, and most importantly - immutable.  \n\nThis sounds simple, but it's a form of a classic problem called the [Byzantine Generals Problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Byzantine_fault).\n\nAs with most of human endeavor, the problem arises with bad actors seeking to cheat the system for their own benefit.  Blockchain is an elegant solution to this problem. \n\nThe most famous, and most valuable, blockchain is called Bitcoin.  It was first described in a [whitepaper](https://bitcoin.org/bitcoin.pdf) released by a person or entity called Satoshi Nakamoto.\n\nA Technical Glossary of terms can be found [here](https://bitcoin.org/en/developer-glossary).",

When you write a good set of unit tests, you can be more confident that your code works the way it's supposed to. Updating, extending, and refactoring code runs the risk of introducing new bugs. Unit tests help significantly reduce this risk. In this lesson, you'll learn how to use Android Studio's tools to add unit tests to your project, how to write basic unit tests, and how to run them to ensure that your code works correctly.",

Now you're going to get started with another language, another ecosystem, and another framework - Python and Django. Your first goal - get set up, learn a bit about the system, and be able to make a simple \"Hello Django\" application.\n\nPython is a pragmatic multiparadigm general purpose programming language with a healthy community and large ecosystem/package library, convenient for small to medium sized projects (and larger ones with proper discipline). Usually when people say \"Python\" they mean CPython 3, which is the reference implementation and what we will use, but other flavors exist as well (IronPython, Jython, PyPy, etc.). Django is, like Python, a pragmatic \"one right way to do it\" system, specifically a web application framework built on the principles of convention over configuration and fast iterative design. It is \"batteries included\", which means it comes with ways to do most common web application tasks (data models, ORM, templates, forms, validation, auth, etc.).\n\nThe Django ecosystem bills itself as \"the web framework for perfectionists with deadlines\" - these many included features are what makes it quick to build an MVP with. We will start by learning about and using these components, and then move on to extend the system and (to some extent) pick and choose the modules we actually want.\n\nFor now - get started by setting out on the objectives, setting up a Python/Django development environment and making a basic Django app. There are also many linked resources to check out for each objective, Django has an excellent community with lots of helpful tutorials and documentation.\n\nGood luck, and have fun getting started with Django!",

            "Description": "This sprint you will be building an application of your own choosing. You are to treat this week as if you are building this application at a company and the instructor is your client. The team leads and section lead will be your main support throughout the week.\n\nThe main objective of this sprint is to develop the MVP features of your application. There are a few requirements that you should do before starting this project:\n\n- You must present your idea to your instructor and have them approve it. This idea can be anything you want, taking into account you will have around 80% of the available time to work on it. Try to keep it feasible given the length of time you have!\n- A solid project plan/research. More details on this below.\n\n## Project Research and Planning\n\nA vital part of any project is planning and research, and writing an application is no exception. This is especially true of a project that you have a deadline for, such as this one and any project you work on at your future job. \n\nFailure to do proper research can result in a significantly shorter amount of time spent working on your application. You may not be a much of a \"planner\", however being able to research and plan out any project including this one is extremely beneficial. We've been able to see hundreds of students build projects with similar time constraints to this one; the quality difference of a well-planned project compared to a poorly or not planned project is often staggering.\n\nOnce you know what kind of project you want to write, take time to do a bit of research. In order to facilitate this process, use the project planner [found here](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/16965587/51573635-6c5cda00-1e67-11e9-93c8-66e73b034456.png). Please watch the video on how to effectively use this project planner as well.\n\nIn the past, students have wanted to use APIs where the API key had to be emailed upon request of the maintainer rather than getting one immediately upon signing up for access. When researching APIs to use be wary of details like this that could cause delays. If you email them even over the weekend before this project starts, there is no guarantee that they will respond. Consider finding another API that has similar information/functionality before resorting to using one like that.\n\nThis principle applies to anything you aren't absolutely sure about. Doing the research **before** you even make an Xcode project and realize that something won't work the way you thought it would is going to save you time and frustration.\n\nProject planning will provide you with a good roadmap to know how long you have to work on each feature and have a **solid** idea of what needs to be done before diving head-first into the project.",

NLTK and spacy (a more recent introduction) are comprehensive Python libraries for natural language processing and text mining/analytics. \n\nSome terms that you need to be aware of:\n\nCorpus (singular) \u2013 is a body of text. The plural of the term is Corpora. An example is a collection of architectural journals\n\nLexicon comprises of words and their meanings. Various fields will have different lexicons. There is a lexicon for doctors, financial professional, mechanics, etc.",

Do we want to test the usability of the design? Do we want to check our users' sentiment towards the aesthetics of the design?

For a UX designer, the ability to reach out to potential or existing customers will pay off in the quality of products she or he is able to design.\n\nEvery product has a target audience. Every website is intended to reach a certain type of people. The temptation is to say something like: \u201cEveryone needs this product!\u201d But, not everyone is going to want or need your product. In fact, no matter what product you build, you will be excluding a vast majority of earth\u2019s inhabitants who won\u2019t have any interest in it or will not be able to access it. When doing research you want to hear from the people who are among the target audience, not the excluded billions. Following effective recruiting processes can help avoid designing for the wrong audience.",

The `master` branch has a skeletal version of the CCA app that might be a useful start to livecoding. It's a React app. All changes to build out should be filling out the functions in App.js. The `solution` branch has the complete version.\n\n###Important Note###\nIf you use an iterative building process, beware that if you implement step() for only one direction, the image will immediately stabilize\nqwqw3.  It will look like it isn't working, but it's just become static.\n\nThere is no Guided demo on B-Day, but it could be used for partial solutions, Q&A, etc.\n\nSprint challenge solution can be found here:\n\nhttps://github.com/LambdaSchool/Sprint-Challenge-Solution--Security-CA\n",

It is designed to expose you to the routines present in most software development environments and give you the opportunity to practice them to the point where you will go into your first job feeling comfortable and ready to contribute.    \n\nIn Labs, sprints and sprint challenges work differently than in other parts of the program.  Each sprint, you will have individual goals and team goals.  The individual goals represent skills that every developer must demonstrate to be successful in a work environment.  The team goals represent the milestones that must be achieved for the project to stay on track.  \n\nFor your sprint challenge, you will use the last day of a sprint to complete an entry in your Development Journal.  This is submitted via a link in your weekly retrospective.  \n\nYour PM will use the content in your Development Journal, and other sources, to evaluate you for this sprint challenge.  If at any point, you are concerned that you will be unable to meet one of the requirements, please contact your PM immediately so that you can work towards a resolution.  A student who misses more than one item in the checklist for a given sprint, or misses the same item in consecutive sprints may be subject to the corrective action plan.\n\nPMs will use this checklist when evaluating a student\u2019s Sprint Challenge Submission.  For three stars, the student must complete every requirement in the checklist at an exceptional standard.  For two stars, the student must complete at least 3 of the 4 items at an adequate level.  \n\n* The student\u2019s github contribution graph shows participation in line with their actual contributions and is similar to those of their teammates and they listed a minimum of four PRs and matching Trello tickets, including a minimum of one front end and one back end\n* The student summarized their weeks work adequately\n* The student adequately performed a detailed analysis of one of their tickets\n* The student adequately answered the weekly reflection question\n\nAdditionally, teams will be tasked with completing a project milestone.  If a team is unable to complete the milestone/learning objectives by the end-of-sprint check-in, they will be given the opportunity to take advantage of the Flex program.  ",

            "Instructor Notes": "Take about 15-20 minutes to introduce them to a Lambda experience.\n\nDay one will shape the students\u2019 experience with Lambda School. First impressions make a big difference on attitude and attitude determines success. *Make this class fun and engaging.* Play interactive games with students to help them get to know each other. \n\nEstablish high expectations for course.\n\nHelp the students recognize the power of a Lambda education. It\u2019s a different educational mind-set\u2013jumping into Lambda School can be a bit of a shock. Our objective is to help students see the value of taking ownership of their own learning and facilitating that growth. \n\nGo over tips for using Slack\n\n-Red question mark for questions\n-Use threads\u2014Keep channel clean\n-Have students ask questions right when they have them\n-Don\u2019t use @channel\n\nIntroduce yourself\u2014Who are you?\n(Consider using your LinkedIn profile to introduce yourself)\n\nHelp students get over the jitters. Help them see there\u2019s opportunity everywhere for those who work hard.\n\nHelp them recognize that if they don't understand something about UX it's not because they're not SMART\u2014throw that word out. Help them understand that familiarity is what we're looking for instead of smart. We\u2019re not dumb, we\u2019re unfamiliar. When you become familiar, you seem smart.\n\nTalk about using the \"Show it off\" rather than the course channel. In the course channel, we're quietly confident about our skills rather than being braggarts. We're supportive and positive. In channel let\u2019s not talk about how easy assignments are. Different students struggle at different things. \u201cThat was so easy,\" shouldn't be something they see in the course channel.\n\nIf they want praise, have them direct message their instructor or PM. As an instructional team, we'll gush over you\u2014or critique you harshly\u2014whichever will help you become a better designer.\n\nAlso, we don\u2019t put up with cyberbullying. Jokes or banter about gender differences, relationships, or sexuality should not take place in our channel or in any channel at Lambda. Religion or politics  should be avoided unless in a channel set up specifically for those types of conversations. But, in all things, we must be respectful of one another.\n\nTalk about learn.lambdaschool.com. Show it and explain what students can find there.\n\nTalk to students about how you expect your class to function. How you want to communicate to them and them to you. Let them know that sometimes you just want them to listen, sometimes you want them working along with you.\n\nYou'll also want them to start looking for a UX manager to contact to try to set up a time to meet or get on a call this week by Friday. That's a big part of our Sprint Challenge.",

Use PropTypes to validate the data that they're passing around through the application as well.",

The React environment used to be one that, when diving into, tripped up a lot of developers coming into the ecosystem. The problems weren't just for beginners either, many experience and seasoned developers had a hard time getting into the React ecosystem at first. \n\nThe idea through this module is to get you prepared to demonstrate the ability to use `Create React App` to build out an application on your own from scratch. This week you'll be working on one single project. Today's focus for that project is to get your project off the ground, and show your PM that you have the ability to think about the Components you'll need for a larger project. Then you'll just be using the tools that you worked on learning last week.",

You start your Lambda journey by diving into your personal tool suite and learning how Xcode supports your application development. You'll tour the app, learn to identify and control the various panes and editors, and write a simple working app on your very first day.\n\nYou'll also review version control. Version control helps you manage project source code and collaborate with others. You'll use this knowledge to participate in Lambda's projects and submit your work to your project managers.  Lambda School uses git, which is the most widely used version control system across iOS development. Version control tracks changes in computer files and coordinates work on those files among multiple people. It is an essential tool for iOS developers, and one you will work with every day. ",

Middleware provide a way to extend the features provided by the Express framework.\n\nThey are implemented as small functions that handle one aspect of our application. Tasks like **authentication** and **logging** are commonly handled by middleware. Another benefit of Middleware is that it provides an easy way to add modularity to our code.\n\nOn this module we'll cover:\n\n- the what, why and how of Middleware.\n- different types of Express Middleware.\n- how to create Custom Middleware.\n- error handling middleware.",

For example, to create a spell checker, you need a huge corpus of words to match against. In this session, we will explore how to access and work with the built-in corpora and we will walk though the process of creating a custom corpus; a custom corpus is essentially just a bunch of text files in a directory.",

As you know from earlier weeks, gathering and cleaning data is generally non-trivial, but it's even trickier when you want to use it to fairly and robustly test various hypotheses.\n\nIn this module we will consider this challenge - how do we design and run an experiment? We will generally focus on web applications as a domain, but these techniques can be applied to any number of products, and indeed scientific scenarios more broadly. There are particular challenges working in the \"real-world\" though, and we will highlight those.",

You are to treat this week as if you are building this application at a company and the instructor is your client. The team leads and section lead will be your main support throughout the week.\n\nThe main objective of this sprint is to develop the MVP features of your application. There are a few requirements that you should do before starting this project:\n\n- You must present your idea to your instructor and have them approve it. This idea can be anything you want, taking into account you will have around 80% of the available time to work on it. Try to keep it feasible given the length of time you have!\n- A solid project plan/research. More details on this below.\n\n## Project Research and Planning\n\nA vital part of any project is planning and research, and writing an application is no exception. This is especially true of a project that you have a deadline for, such as this one and any project you work on at your future job. \n\nFailure to do proper research can result in a significantly shorter amount of time spent working on your application. You may not be a much of a \"planner\", however being able to research and plan out any project including this one is extremely beneficial. We've been able to see hundreds of students build projects with similar time constraints to this one; the quality difference of a well-planned project compared to a poorly or not planned project is often staggering.\n\nOnce you know what kind of project you want to write, take time to do a bit of research. In order to facilitate this process, use the project planner [found here](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/16965587/51573635-6c5cda00-1e67-11e9-93c8-66e73b034456.png). Please watch the video on how to effectively use this project planner as well.\n\nIn the past, students have wanted to use APIs where the API key had to be emailed upon request of the maintainer rather than getting one immediately upon signing up for access. When researching APIs to use be wary of details like this that could cause delays. If you email them even over the weekend before this project starts, there is no guarantee that they will respond. Consider finding another API that has similar information/functionality before resorting to using one like that.\n\nThis principle applies to anything you aren't absolutely sure about. Doing the research **before** you even make an Xcode project and realize that something won't work the way you thought it would is going to save you time and frustration.\n\nProject planning will provide you with a good roadmap to know how long you have to work on each feature and have a **solid** idea of what needs to be done before diving head-first into the project.",

Dive more deeply into doubly linked lists. Live code a simple one in C so students gets a bit more comfortable working with one.\n\n2. Walk through an LRU cache implementation in Python to give the students a better idea of how one works: https://github.com/LambdaSchool/Data-Structures/tree/extras/lru_cache\n\n3. Explore the topic of caching strategies more in-depth. Talk a bit more at length about different caching strategies and what their pros and cons are. The goal here is certainly not to have students memorize these caching strategies, but more to raise their awareness of different caching patterns, and more importantly, to get them to analyze the benefits and tradeoffs of different caching strategies and think about use-cases when one is more appropriate than another. https://codeahoy.com/2017/08/11/caching-strategies-and-how-to-choose-the-right-one/\n\n4.

Top Right Bottom Left === \"TRBL.\"  I will often say \"You will be in TRBL if you forget the shorthand order!\"\n* Display types: none, block, inline, inline-block, brief mention of flexbox for tomorrow but don't cover it today.\n* Positioning: static, relative, absolute, fixed\n* HUGE concept with positioning absolute or fixed is the parent must have relative assigned or it will try to match the window's position.\n* z-index explained in combination with position fixed/absolute\n",

Don't panic!  There is a huge amount of content here, but this lesson is intended to provide an overview of the fundamentals of computer theory and give context to the work that we do.  \n\nDay 1 lecture:  Theory of Computing and Intro to State Machines\n*[Min 0 - 20]  Start with asking for opinions and thoughts on Thomson's videos.  Keep the discussion on track, but let it flow around between the different areas that the students found interesting or pertinent.\n\n*[Min 20 - 40] Using the info in the TK as a guide, review the history of computing and why it is important.  Key points:\n**Much of this has been around for a very long time.  The foundations of what became our Boolean algebra started with Greek philosophers in 300 BCE.\n**  The formal definition of a Turing machine looks a little complex and confusing.  The important point here is that this represents two things:\n1.  Before this, no one knew if general computing was possible.  There were many mechanical computers that did one specific task, such as adding machines, navigational aids, or even the Antikythera mechanism.  But it was unknown if a machine could be constructed that could compute any algorithm that could be calculated by a person by hand.  Turing, Church, and others proved that it was.  Any mathematical process that can be computed by a person, can be computed by a machine of this type.\n2.  While they proved that general computing was possible, they also proved that there is a set of problems that are inherently unsolvable by computing/algorithms/computers, whether by hand or by machine (specifically, the halting problem).\n[20 mins]  Discuss the background of logic and math as it relates to CS.  Ancient Greek philosophy eventually led to  if(a == b), etc.\n\n[Min 40 - 60] Intro to finite state machines.\n**  Digital/Discrete vs. Continuous/Analog.  Computers are very complex, deterministic, finite state machines\n**  Important for mindset of computing.  Can you draw a diagonal line with a computer?\n**  Also useful for converting abstract processes into computer thinking.  \n\n[Min 60 - 65] Break\n\n[Min 65 - 85] Explain examples of state machines in TK\n\n[Min 85 - 105] Show the state machine creator at madebyevan.com/fsm/  and walk the class through creating an improved version of the vending machine state machine that can handle invalid coins and give change.\n\n[Min 105 - 110] Answer questions\n\n[Min 110 - 120]  Introduce the project (https://github.com/LambdaSchool/Theory-Of-Computation)\nStudents should complete the state diagram exercise tonight and if they have time should look over the regex challenge for tomorrow.\n\nDay 2 Lecture:  Regular Expressions\n[Min 0 - 20] Solution lecture for the blinker diagram and for a video game AI.\n\n[Min 20 - 50] Start with state machines applied to the task of going through a string characters and changes states with the input of certain characters to read through and complete if it finds...\n1.  goal\n2.  gooooal - or any variant with o's\n3.  goooool - also allow for a Spanish varient of the spelling \n4.  Build with letters as input to go forward and not letters [^g], etc. to go backwards.\n5.  Reduce the final state machine diagram to a regular expression \n    a.  Use regular expression notation for the inputs - o+ and a?\n    b.  It is implied that it will reset if it fails, so get rid of the return to starts\n\n[Min 50 - 55] Break\n\n[Min 55 - 95] Introduce regexr.com and run through the example there\n* Different variations of goal and gol\n* Discuss flags\n* Explore the built in reference and test out other types of symbols that can be used\n* Demo attempting to pull email addresses out of a block of text.  Discuss why a full-proof solution is difficult.\n* Demo greedy vs. lazy\n\n[Min 95 - 115] Demonstrate regex in JavaScript in a Node instance\n*  Share the Mozilla reference page and refer to it in the demo:  https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/RegExp\n*  Demo s.match with goal: \ns = \"goooal\";\ns.match(/go+al/);\n* Demo the difference in results when you use capturing groups (parens around parts of the regex)\n* Store this in a variable (m = s.match(...)\n* Store regex in variable r\n* Show r.exec(s) as the inverse of s.match(r)\n* Show the /g flag returning all possible results instead of the first\n\n\n[Min 115 - 120]\nAnswer questions.  Remind everyone about the second part of the project - pulling links from StackOverflow, and matching phone numbers.\n\nLead the class to making the decision to start by figuring out the regexes needed for the project using the tools in regexr.\n\n",

Another part of it is keeping track of which blocks are allocated.\n\nStart the students off with the following givens:\n* You have a disk that is addressable by block (AKA sector) number, blocks 0-9999999.\n* Each block holds 1024 bytes of data.\n* The filesystem does _not_ need to support subdirectories.\n* You should be able to store multiple files of various sizes.\n\n## Known solutions\n\n### Commodore64-ish\n\n* For keeping track of free blocks, some blocks hold a map of boolean values. If a value in the map is false for a particular block, that means the block is available. Think of it as a big array of `bool`s, packed in as individual bits.\n* The directory is kept in a well-known location on disk somewhere. It is a list of entries that hold name and size information, as well as the number of the first block in the file data.\n* For tracking where file data is, the filesystem uses a linked list structure. The first (or last) bytes of the block are reserved as a pointer to the next block. A pointer value of `0` indicates the last block of the file. The exact size of the file can be determined from the directory entry.\n\n### Unix-ish, inodes\n\n* A list of free blocks is kept in a well-known location on disk. When a new block is allocated, it is removed from the free list.\n* The directory is kept in a well-known location on disk. It holds _inodes_, where there is 1 inode per file. The inode holds the name, size, etc. as well as a handful of pointers to the first blocks of the file.\n* If those few pointers are not enough to refer to all the blocks the file needs, the inode includes a _single indirect_ pointer to a block. This block is a list of additional blocks in the file.\n* If the direct and indirect block lists are not enough, the inode also has a _double indirect_ pointer to a block. This block is a list of pointers to single indirect blocks, which are all pointers to blocks.\n* [Image of the above and more info](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inode_pointer_structure)\n\n# Project Notes\nThis is the implementation of a web server in C.\n\nAll the hard stuff is written in the skeleton on the `master` branch. Networking is included. The main loop is included.\n\nThe work the students have to do is:\n* Understand how HTTP works, what requests and responses look like.\n* Be able to do a lot of string manipulation in C.\n   * They have to parse request headers.\n   * They have to build responses.\n* Be able to add code to an existing codebase.\n\nIntroduce this project by describing it as (one of the) first opportunities they have to work on something more like a real world programming task in C.  They will be working in a small part of a larger project.  \n\nThey do not need to understand the specific details of the entire project any more than you would need to know the entire layout of a city to follow directions from one address to another.  \n\nInstead, help them get started by walking through the process of orienting themselves to the program and finding their bearings.  To do this, we need to find out where we are and what our first task is to start us in the right direction:\n1.  Read over the instructions in detail (this should be done before class)\n2.  Skim over the program to get an idea of what it entails.  Don't worry to much about the complicated and esoteric functions at the top.  Just acknowledge that they are complicated and esoteric, then move on.\n3.  Recognize the `handle_http_request()` function from the `Main Goals` of the readme.  This is where we start!\n4.  Acknowledge that this is where we start, and move on to review the rest of the program.  \n5.  Compile!  Then make the minor changes necessary to successfully compile the program.  \n6.  We know that we're supposed to do something with `handle_http_request()`.  Write a comment in that function, then compile and \n6.  We are ready to start.  Refer back to the `Main Goals`.  Our first task is the simplest thing we can parse out of here.  In this case, it is to \n\n[See the README for more info](https://github.com/LambdaSchool/C-Web-Server).",

These templates are called _design patterns_. Design patterns aren't dogmatic sets of rules that you must _always_ follow. Rather, they're a toolbox full of ideas that will help you make sense of and structure your code so that it's good. That is, so that it's understandable, readable, maintainable, debuggable, extensible, performant, and reliable.\n\nIn this module, you'll learn a few of the most common and useful design patterns used when developing iOS apps.",

It can be numeric, in the the form of paragraphs of text, and even in picture form such as charts, graphs and maps. Given that data comes in many forms, it is important to prepare the data before it can be used to train your Machine Learning algorithms.\n\nData preparation involves a range of activities from 1) joining two or more data sets together to 2) reducing data sets to only a select group of variables to 3) cleansing data to eliminate anomalies such as outlier observations or missing data to 4) re-formatting data for consistency purposes.\n\nThe more disciplined you are in preparing your data, the more consistent and better results you are like likely to achieve from your Machine Learning algorithms. The process for getting data ready for training a machine learning algorithm revolves around 3 key steps:\n\n1. Selecting the data\n2. Pre-processing the data i.e. treat missing values and eradicating duplicates\n3. Concatenating and Transforming the data \n\nIn this module, we will touch on each of the aforementioned topics.",

For code (and science) to really work, it must be *reproducible*.\n\nWe've already learned about `pipenv` as a Python packaging tool, which goes a long way towards giving reproducible builds - but for even greater reproducibility (and deployability), *containers* are the tool of choice. A container is a minimal virtual operating system, complete with all the software needed to run the desired application. Because they pack everything together, they are truly *identical* to run regardless of host.\n\nDocker is a common standard and tool for containers, and we will use it to build and run Linux containers with Python code.",

From Linux to React, it is hard to imagine going an entire day in 2018 without touching a piece of open source software. While many companies sponsor the development of open source tools, the vast majority of open source work is contributed by volunteers. Getting involved in the open source community is a great way to give back, to learn new things, collaborate with a diverse and distributed team, and to enhance your skills as a software developer. Hiring managers view open source contributions as very strong positive signals and having this kind of work in your portfolio will help you get more meetings. ",

You'll learn about Stack Views, the \"one size fits all\" solution to most Auto Layout requirements. Stack Views simplify many layout tasks, allowing you to build columns and rows of visual elements and then join them together to create a coherent presentation.",

What is the chance that I will get 2 3's on the next roll of the dice? What is the probability that the Golden State Warriors will win the NBA championship in 2018? Probability is usually depicted as a \"ratio\" or a \"percent\" and is computed by dividing the desired outcome by the total # of possible outcomes. \n\nA key point to note is that the probability of all possible outcomes will sum to 100%. To illustrate this point, let's look at an example: When you toss a coin, you can can either a heads or a tails. What is the probability of getting a heads? It is 1 (desired outcome) divided by 2 (# of possible outcomes). There is a 50% chance you will gets a heads and there is a 50% chance you will get tails. The sum of all possible outcomes is 100%.\n\nIn this session, we will cover the following range of topics:\n1) Probability of multiple events (including Bayes Theorem)\n2) Model continuous random variables with a Probability Density Function",

Rather than force developers to handcraft SQL queries for these interactions, most web application frameworks encourage the use of an object-relational mapping (ORM) that allows the developer to naturally use classes/objects that represent their data and builds/executes the appropriate queries for them.\n\nThere are many advantages to this approach, most notably abstraction from the specific underlying database (allowing you to swap them more easily) and protection from SQL injection and other security risks. The cost is it\u2019s difficult for an ORM to be as expressive and powerful as SQL, and it\u2019s possible to misuse an ORM to accidentally build really inefficient queries (granted it\u2019s also possible to misuse SQL in the same way). The Django ORM does a pretty good job of balancing usability and power, and with proper use can efficiently perform the vast majority of database interactions you are likely to need to do.",

Sampling is a process that is related to the selection of individual observations; it helps us make statistical inferences about the population. Accumulating all the information about the population (a census) is time consuming and expensive. Therefore, sampling is performed to make inferences about the population. In sampling, we assume that samples are drawn from the population and sample means and population means are equal. \n\nGiven that a sample is a group of individual observations drawn from a population, the # of individual units or observations that constitute a sample is known as the sample size. Since the intent of the sample is to provide a representative picture of the entire population, the larger the sample size, the more accurate is the measurement and the more confidence we have that the sample is actually representative of the whole population. \n\nWe will delve further into sampling and sample sizes which will help us grasp the topic: What is the standard error of a sample? Let's say we have a distribution of continuous random variables. From the distribution, we take a sample of 10 observations and plot the average of the 10 observations.\n\nWe repeat this exercise several times, on each occasion we gather a sample of 10 observations from the distribution and plot the average of the 10 observations. As we keep repeating this exercise, the sampling distribution of the sample mean will represent a normal distribution.\n\nIf we were to repeat the entire exercise with larger sample sizes, the curve would become narrower, taller and the standard deviation would be tighter. You will notice that with larger sample sizes, the sample mean will approach the population mean. The Standard Error (SE) tells you how far your sample mean deviates from the population mean.\n\nRemember, the larger your sample size, the closer your sample mean is to the actual population mean. Note that the Standard Error is very similar to the Standard Deviation. Both are measures of spread. The higher the number, the more spread out your data is.\n\nHowever, there is a key difference between the Standard Error and Standard Deviation. The standard error uses statistics (i.e. sample data) whereas the standard deviation uses population data. The standard deviation of the sampling distribution of the sample mean is also called the standard error of the mean and is computed as follows: sd of sampling distribution of sample mean/square of n (i.e. sample size).",

Then, we will look at how to find the \"head\" of a sentence which denotes the most important word in the sentence. Finally, we will review the topic of \"Named Entity Recognition\" which helps in finding named entities within sentences such as places, people, things, monetary figures, etc.",

The main aspect of sentiment analysis is to analyze a body of text in order to decipher the opinion expressed by it including factors like emotion, feelings and mood. \n\nSentiment Analysis works best on text that has a subjective context rather than an objective context. When a body of text has an objective perspective, it usually reflects real factual statements with no emotion or feelings associated with it. In contrast, subjective text includes opinions encompassing emotions and feelings that are expressed by humans. Given the proliferation of social media channels, Sentiment Analysis is increasingly being leveraged by a host of entities (be it a business, a public sector organization, government, etc.) to extract the subjective and opinion related information like emotions, attitude, mood and use the extracted subjective information to the detect the sentiment of people.\n\nSentiment analysis can be defined as a classification problem in which the classification is either \u2014binary classification (positive or negative) and multi-class classification (positive, negative, or neutral). \n\nIn this module, we will explore a range of related topics encompassing 1) Constructing a Sentiment Analysis Model, 2) Determining the subjectivity of text, 3) Examining the intensity or polarity of a sentiment and 4) Performing sentiment analysis on tweets. As we step through the topics, each subsequent topic will build on the previous one. We will start off with text classification for sentiment analysis.",

In this module we will go over both MVC as a design pattern and Django as one implementation of that design pattern, and see how we can use it to build our first full Django web application.",

How do you talk about your previous unrelated experience? What if you don\u2019t have any previous experience? What if the other person doesn\u2019t \u201cget it\u201d or care? These are all valid concerns, but you control how your story is told, not other people, and in today\u2019s lesson we\u2019re going to go over how to craft a powerful narrative that you feel confident relaying to others.",

Numerical analysis.\n\nThe first and most classical way to interpret data is to enter all of the values into some equation, then solve the equation for the desired result. Linear systems of equations are one of the more common approaches, but even our ever familiar `y = f(x)` is an example of this approach.\n\nThis approach works well when the data is simple enough to work out  by hand, though there are automated matrix approaches to compute these solutions that work with linear and nonlinear regressions.\n\nConsider a dataset of local weather values:\n\n| baro press | date | time | yesterday high| \nprecip chance | temp\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | ---|\n| | | | | | |\n| 1.1 | 2018-01-01 | 12:00 | 34 | 15 | 39 |\n\nWith this data it is easy to create an equation to solve for the temperature given any other dataset (though the equation isn't likely to be correct)\n\n<img src=\"https://www.dropbox.com/s/hogy1q2nyxd9hj1/Data_Visualization-NumericalAnalysis.gif?raw=1\" alt=\"1.1a + b + 12c + 34d + 15e = f\">\n\nThis approach works well for small datasets and can produce some information about the data, but becomes immediately unwieldy when the data is large.\n\n#### 2. Machine learning model\n\nInstead of computing the result of the above equation directly, models have been designed to provide an answer without requiring the mathematician to solve the above equation. We will be studying these models, their implementation, and their usefulness over the rest of this course.\n\n#### 3. Visualization\n\nGetting good results with Machine Learning means choosing the right model for the job. Before you as an ML engineer can choose the right tool, you need to learn how to visualize your data.\n\nIn this section, you're going to learn how to visualize data in the three most popular mathematical programming environments: numpy, R, and matlab/octave.\n\n<a href=\"https://matplotlib.org/mpl_toolkits/mplot3d/tutorial.html\">Many great 3D plots and their code samples in matplotlib</a>",

            "Description": "Up through this point, as you have been working through the Web curriculum, even though data structures were never officially introduced, you were making extensive use of them all the time. Python lists and dictionaries are so useful and versatile that they were included as standard in the language.\n\nIndeed, data structures are extremely prevalent and fundamental when it comes to understanding programming and computer science. By the end of the Computer Science curriculum, you\u2019ll have a good idea of the answers to important questions that were raised during the web curriculum such as \u2018how do web servers such as Express effectively and efficiently handle hundreds or thousands of concurrent requests simultaneously?\u2019 or \u2018how does a database like MongoDB organize the data that it stores in such a way that it can then retrieve it as quickly as possible?\u2019. Such questions can be answered in part by having an understanding of both the wide berth of all the currently-existing data structures that have been dreamt as well as an adequately deep understanding of how many common data structures work.\n\nAs part of your first Data Structures sprint, we\u2019ll be learning about and implementing some very common and fundamental data structures that are very often used to implement more complex and specialized data structures. These are the:\n\n - Linked List (singly- and doubly-linked)\n - Queue\n - Binary Search Tree\n - Heap\n\nEach of these data structures has its own associated strengths and weaknesses. Think of each of them as a tool in a toolbox. You have entirely different classes of tools such as hammers and wrenches that are each used for entirely different use cases. You also have multiple types of screwdrivers. Both are used for tightening and untightening screws, but the Phillips screwdriver is better for certain screws and the flathead screwdriver is better for other types of screws.\n\nThe same can be said of data structures. There are many instances of wildly different data structures that serve entirely different use cases, and then you have data structures that can both perform the same function, but one will be better at it than the other. More specifically, you could emulate the functionality of a JavaScript Array using an Object, but an Object isn\u2019t going to perform as efficiently when it comes to certain tasks that Arrays are really efficient at.",

Clone the project to a new folder and install all dependencies to make sure there are no errors.\n\nComing into the lecture students should have a basic understanding of HTTP (methods and status codes) as it was covered in the `Single Page Applications` module on the front end. At this point we do not introduce `REST` yet.\n\nOn this lecture we should provide a gentle introduction to the following topics:\n\n- introduction to node.js and express. (augmented by preclass reading/videos)\n  - what is node.js, why do I care?\n  - what is express, why do I care?\n  - relationship between express and node.js.\n- high level overview of the main features of Express.\n  - routing.\n  - middleware.\n  - sub-applications (Express Routers).\n  - views\n- introduce routing and request handler functions\n\nEach topic is broken down into three parts:\n\n- I do: in the form of a short demo or explanation of concepts that require no code.\n- We do: where students follow along with code or provide ideas on concepts still not explained by the instructor.\n- You do: small code challenge related to what was just covered on the prior to sections. For explanations (no code) have review questions for students to answer.\n\nWe don't need to go deep into `Node.js`, the focus is on building `RESTful APIs` using `Express`.\n\nWe do, however, provide a strong conceptual understanding of the `Express` framework, it's main features and gotchas.\n\n\nBY THE END OF THE WEEK A STUDENT SHOULD HAVE COMPLETED THIS SERVER DURING THEIR RECORDED LECTURES BEFORE CLASS (https://gist.github.com/ryan-hamblin/f112a8e2f7656ae02bd47cb1fc819b41)",

We'll also learn about the foundations of statistics - probability and set theory - where the pure mathematics comes from.\n\nAs with all data science, there are many methods here, and we will cover the solid foundation and most generally useful tools.",

I prefer to use the most popular online guide to flexbox:  https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/\n\nLast time I taught this:\n\nhttps://codepen.io/lambdaschool/pen/bmEyNb?editors=1100\n\nIMPORTANT:  It is of major importance to describe that flexbox is a module with many parts and rules.  Example: \n\n\ndisplay: none; does one thing!\n\ndisplay: flex; enables a whole module of properties.  Make sure this is clearly understood.  Otherwise, students think display: flex; is just a single property and don't everything else as smooth.\n\nIMPORTANT: Make sure students know that there is a flex container and flex items within that container and each concept have its own properties.  This concept seems to escape many new learners.  Repeat this and showcase this in the guided demo many times.  \n\nTEACHING TIP: Focus on describing the two main axes of a flex container and how flexbox is one directional.  The faster students can understand that there is a main and cross axis the better.\n\nA good tip is that any flexbox property with \"align\" in its name is automatically assumed to be manipulating the cross axis.  Where a flexbox property with \"justify\" is on the main axis.",

There is an `immutability.js` file in the Redux Mini project for use during breakout sessions. \n\nThe approach from \"What is Redux and what problems does it solve?\" to \"Here's how to implement Redux in a React app\" needs to be overhauled. \n\nThis is the last time that I taught it (July 9, 2018):\nThese repls coincide with a follow along. The firstTimeRedux example I give the students to work through with me at times.\nThe solution is also posted below\nWhat we're trying to build here is a simple Redux app that changes the three fields on the initialState object. \n\nhttps://repl.it/@ryan_ham/firstTimeRedux \n\nhttps://repl.it/@ryan_ham/ReduxFirstTimeSolution \n\nThis is an example application that I built in class that consumes some data, and toggles some state data as well. It's a bit more sophisticated than the counter example that they'll use in the afternoon, but it's not too drastically different than the Todos app that they'll build over the first two days.\n\nhttps://codesandbox.io/s/10q101x244 \n\n\nHere is a codesandbox.io containing everything needed for a super basic react w/ redux implementation: https://codesandbox.io/s/mjv9j1kn4j\n\nHere is the Repl.it that I have the students work on on Day II of redux during the demo. This can be done in breakout rooms, or have them work on it alone for 10 min.\n\nAsk them (w/ polly anonymously) how far they got on implementing the `REMOVE` portion of this project.\n\nhttps://repl.it/@ryan_ham/redux-breakdown",

Redux is a library that can help solve this problem by providing a single source of truth for our data within our application. As your team grows, and as your application scales, Redux can help offset the pains that can be brought on as a result of complexity.",

You need to make sure your PMs are hounding the students for project requirements all week long.\n\nThis spreadsheet is super helpful in tracking progress throughout the week.  Be sure to copy it and make a new one for your cohort:\n\nhttps://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ytLEJv1nt2CEbdzhIEYM9mWyMbfjnJCLXzJ2xrahYkQ/edit#gid=0\n\n* Morning code challenges were removed for this week to allow more time on the project.\n\n* The normal guided demo time should instead be used as a short (45 mins max) demo of the objective topics and NOT code reviews.\n\n* The first day of the project should be used to explain the format of the week.  The format can be however you like it but an effective way is to break down the days like this:\n\nDay 1: Trello board and initial pull request committed for PM to review.\n\nDay 2: MVP could be complete by several students at this stage but the general expectation is that most students will be finished with 1 to 2 features.\n\nDay 3: Students should be near completion of the MVP. \n\nDay 4: MVP should be complete and new features being looked at\n\nDay 5: MVP completed, some features added, and a demo afternoon is used to showcase work.  We used 2pm PST as the deadline for the MVP project.\n\nDemo Format:\nSome groups will be larger than others, if your project managers have a larger group, encourage them to reduce the time to just 2 minutes.  It's very important that every student demos even if they aren't 100% complete.  \n\nCohort Wide:\n* 2 demos per group\n* 2 minute demos showcasing their features\n\nGroup Wide:\n* Everyone demos 2 mins max with a 3 minute Q&A\n* Prepare to talk briefly talk about what was most challenging\n* Prepare to talk briefly talk about what was most rewarding\n\nNOTE: Finishing the MVP is not as important as the learning behind it.  Stress this with your group of project managers and students.  If you feel a student is completely over their head after the week is over, report progress to our Director of Student Success.\n\n\nHere is the color scheme /fonts for the students: \n\n```md\nHeading font: Roboto Bold\nEverything else font: Raleway Medium\n\nHeading and main font color: #4A4A4A\nButton font color: #FFFFFF\n\nSidebar background: #D8D8D8\nMain background: #F3F3F3\nMain button background: #2BC1C4\nDelete button background: #D0021B\nBorder color used throughout: #979797\n```",

While it\u2019s not a \u201csyndrome\u201d in the clinical sense, they called it this after observing academics and professionals with pervasive self-doubt, even despite plenty of external evidence of their accomplishments, skills, intelligence, and capability.**\n\n**While imposter syndrome might seem like an inconvenience or just a bad feeling, it can actually have a real impact on your career success; people who experience imposter syndrome may be less likely to be promoted, may have lower salaries, and may feel less overall job satisfaction.

Rather than force developers to handcraft SQL queries for these interactions, most web application frameworks encourage the use of an object-relational mapping (ORM) that allows the developer to naturally use classes/objects that represent their data and builds/executes the appropriate queries for them.\n\nThere are many advantages to this approach, most notably abstraction from the specific underlying database (allowing you to swap them more easily) and protection from SQL injection and other security risks. The cost is it's difficult for an ORM to be as expressive and powerful as SQL, and it's possible to misuse an ORM to accidentally build really inefficient queries (granted it's also possible to misuse SQL in the same way). The Django ORM does a pretty good job of balancing usability and power, and with proper use can efficiently perform the vast majority of database interactions you are likely to need to do.",

Graphic designers can focus on the fixed size of a poster; print designers can be sure that paper sizes aren\u2019t changing tomorrow; architects know that the building foundation won\u2019t change, but our designs need to work across an incredible array of shapes and sizes - from tiny iWatches all the way up to digital billboards.\n\nFortunately, over the last 10 years or so, UX/UI designers have worked to solve this problem and have found ways to design for the infinite variety of screens. In this lesson, we\u2019ll dive into this exciting world and learn how to embrace the shifting screens of our digital medium.",

Used to implement everything from objects in JavaScript and dictionaries in Python to Memcached over a distributed computer network, hash tables are beloved by programmers for providing key/value storage with constant big-O time complexity for insertion, deletion and search.\n\nWe will be looking underneath the hood at how this delightful data structure works and answering questions like, how do hash tables work? What is a hash function? What is a hash collision and how are they handled? What is the \"birthday problem\"? What do we do when our hash table is full?\n\nYou can think of hash tables as extensions of arrays. In class, we will implement arrays and compare them to linked lists.  For your project, you will use this knowledge to implement hash tables in Python.\n\nAt first glance, this may seem like a silly task.  After all, both of these data structures are already built into Python and their implementations are fast, full of features, and of course, already working.  \n\nThe reason we are doing this isn't so that when we're done we will _have_ an implementation of these data structures.  We do it so that we can obtain a deeper _understanding_ of how our predecessors have invented elegant solutions to difficult problems so that we are better equipped to to solve the problems we will encounter on the job.

You can verify that your functions actually return the correct results for a given set of arguments. You can ensure that your classes behave correctly in various situations. When you write a good set of unit tests, you can be more confident that your code works the way it's supposed to. Updating, extending, and refactoring code runs the risk of introducing new bugs. Unit tests help significantly reduce this risk. In this lesson, you'll learn how to use Xcode's tools to add unit tests to your project, how to write basic unit tests, and how to run them to ensure that your code works correctly.",

            "Description": "Now that we've talked a bit about processes and you know that every program running on your computer is a process that\nthe operating system kernel much allocate CPU time for, it's time to talk about how the OS kernel performs this task.\n\nIn essence, there is a special program the kernel executes called the scheduler, whose sole job is to decide, out of \nall of the processes vying for execution time from the CPU, which one actually gets to go next? There are many algorithms\nthat can be used to answer this question. Some examples include:\n\n * First In, First Out: Super simple and easy to implement, but what happens when a really long process comes along\n right before a bunch of short jobs. At that point, our scheduler algorithm is extremely inefficient.\n\n * Shortest Job First: Also very simple and easy to implement, but it's unfair to processes that may require a lot of\n processing time, but are very important.\n\n  * Round Robin: Definitely the most fair scheduling algorithm, since every process will get attention from the CPU and\n  at least make some progress on running to completion, but then performance may be affected since we're spreading CPU\n  time between many different vying processes all at once. \n\nSo it turns out, when it comes to deciding on a good scheduling algorithm, there are a number of criteria that need to \nbe accounted for and balanced. We want our scheduler to minimize _turnaround time_, which is defined as the amount of \ntime from when a process completed execution and when that process first arrived in the queue of processes. This is \nimportant because we don't want unfinished processes sitting around for longer than they need to.\n\nWe also want to minimize _response time_, which is defined as the amount of time from when a process gets scheduled\nand when it first arrived in the scheduler's queue. This is also important because we want processes to get scheduled\nas soon as possible. Notice though how a scheduling algorithm like Shortest Job First minimizes turnaround time at the \ndirect cost of response time, since shortest jobs are prioritized above longer processes, meaning the longer processes\ndon't get completed (or even scheduled) for a long time. \n\nLikewise, with a Round Robin scheduling algorithm, better response time is achieved at the direct cost of turnaround \ntime, since processes get scheduled and start executing very quickly, but processes take more time overall to complete.\n\nThere are other constraints as well placed upon the operating system scheduler that I haven't even mentioned. One of the \nbig ones is that the operating system doesn't actually know how long a process needs to run for. That's _impossible_ to \nknow. So it turns out that an algorithm like Shortest Job First isn't even actually possible! On top of that, processes\ncould go into a blocking state, like if it needs to perform some I/O operation. In that case, the scheduler will want \nto be efficient and yield the CPU to another process waiting in line, since the blocking process isn't going to make\nprogress towards completing until its I/O operation is complete. \n\nSo the fundamental question underlying the concept of scheduling is: what scheduling algorithm will allow us to \nminimize both turnaround time and response time without actually knowing how long each process needs to run for, \nplus account for the fact that processes may enter a blocking state? There are, of course, other factors to \nconsider for OS developers who write real, everyday-use scheduling algorithms, but these constraints are enough \nfor a relatively simple implementation.\n\n### Multi-level Feedback Queue\n\nOne of the most well-known approaches to tackling the problem of scheduling is the Multi-level Feedback Queue, or MLFQ. \nThe MLFQ attempts to address the constraints we just mentioned by \"learning\" the characteristics of each process as the \nsystem runs, so that it can make better scheduling decisions.\n\nThe architecture of the MLFQ comprises of a number of distinct queues, each assigned a different priority level. At any \ngiven time, a process that is ready to run is placed on a single queue. The MLFQ uses priority levels to decide which \nprocess should run at a given time. Of course, more than one process may be in a given queue, and thus have the same \npriority, in which case the MLFQ runs these processes in round-robin fashion. \n\nThe key to the MLFQ lies in how the scheduler sets priorities. Rather than giving a fixed priority to each process, the \nMLFQ varies the priority of each process based upon its observed behavior. For example, if a process repeatedly relinquishes \nthe CPU because it's waiting on input, the MLFQ will keep its priority high, since this process may be interactive, and \nnecessitates high response time. If a process uses the CPU intensively for long periods of time, the MLFQ will reduce its \npriority level. In this way, the MLFQ tries to learn about processes as they run, and thus use the history of the process \nto predict its future behavior.",

To do so, do the following:\n\n* Send out a job application-like form to incoming students to get a feel for personality, fit, interest, etc. (including asking who they might want to work with, and who they definitely would not want to work with)\n* Invite the Project Managers who've been working with the students, and the instructor who most recently worked with them\n* Create a spreadsheet with a projects column and spaces for each of the students\n* Divide the students to create equitable teams, dividing up students who will need more attention, and the all-stars\n\nHere's an example of a message you might send to incoming students before this module:\n\n> (Insert Ryan's cool message here.)",

During this kickoff, you'll get into your teams, and learn how to succeed at Labs by following best practices for how to work together in a team to deliver an awesome product by the end of your time here.\n\nHere's a quick reminder of what Lambda Labs is all about:\n\nLambda Labs is our immersive capstone experience. Students will be split in to small teams and assigned a project to work on and a PM to work with. \n\nEach team will start the week with a Trello board full of tasks to complete, wireframes, and a design document. This experience will look and feel like a job at a real world dev shop. \n\nStudents will start each day with a stand up meeting, led by their PM, they\u2019ll have sprint objectives to complete, participate in code reviews and pair programming, and have a client to impress. \n\nWe also focus heavily on \u201cJob Interview Preparation\u201d during Lambda Labs so students will participate in mock interviews and whiteboard interview practice sessions as well as workshops lead by our Career Services team. The Career Services curriculum is documented in a separate Sprint.\n\nThe Labs experience culminates with a Capstone Defense, where each student individually will present their capstone project to a panel of Lambda School instructors, staff, and outside hiring partners. This is the \u201cFinal Exam\u201d of the program.",

Also, apply a basic CSS style using django-bootstrap4, and encourage students to customize from there.\n\nThere are a ton of design patterns, and not all of them really \"caught on\" - the material focuses on factories, decorators, lazy initialization, and iterators as the most commonly seen in practice. MVC and ORM could also both be seen as design patterns, but are treated as separate modules, but can be foreshadowed a bit here if time allows.",

Clone the project to a new folder and install all dependencies to make sure there are no errors.\n\n* _Progress without understanding is just moving forward in a random direction._\n* I always like to start off Testing week with a discussion on \"how\" software gets built. I end up spending more time than I probably ought to fleshing out for the students the different examples of dev teams that I've been a part of.\n* This commonly leads to a discussion about `project/feature planning`. I love giving the following story to the students as piece of advice.\n\nWhile at Nok\u0113 our software team was constantly working under the gun. We had a product, that many big important companies were beta testing. Our software was unique in that it was an application that interfaced with hardware. As goes the story with many start ups, our CEO was running around trying to land certain investments and projects to keep us a float while we were able to show off to investors how effectively our team was able to perform.\n\nWe ended up building a prototype lock that could be installed to work with a storage unit, and of course, we needed an app to deliver along with it. Because the hardware was so drastically different we had to approach this as a nearly brand new app, not just a skin/clone of our previous system. Our deadline? 3 weeks!\n\nWith a tight deadline, and a CEO out in Georgia on business, (leaving us to our own devises) our dev team did what we do best, we planned. Three business days of planning and writing tests, and boiler-plating, and white boarding, and arguing/discussing we came up with a battle plan. We knew how fast we could work as a team, dividing our expectations and tasks up into different portions of work and finally, began writing real code.\n\nWe not only ended up shipping the app on time (and it wasn't trivial), but we got MVP a few days early which gave us time to flesh out bugs + add on features we didn't think we'd be touching. The moral of the story here is that planning out your understanding of the problem at hand, and breaking down the work will help you immensely as a developer. As I got to my desk on Thursday morning of Week 1, I had the majority my tests written for what my code should look like, how it should perform and what any expected/anticipated behaviors we might encounter. Of course not everything accounted for. But It allowed me to move forward confident, and build rapidly each feature that needed to be a part of the project.",

Flashy animations work against deferential design. Animations should be small, supportive, and seemingly effortless. Animation serves the interface and should not be the focal point of any GUI.\n\nBecause they are so fundamental to the user experience, animation technology exists in many forms and at many levels in the system APIs provided by Apple. Older APIs are more configurable. They provide powerful access to realizing any raw animation you can imagine. Newer APIs are more focused. They offer pre-built hooks to create a uniform user experience across devices.\n\nToday, you're going to build a basic framework for visualizing animations and then explore both some animation theory and the UIKit technologies that realize that theory.",

            "Instructor Notes": "Students should be lead through a discussion about \"Why React is important\" and \"what problems it solves\". When learning something as complicated as React it is important to understand context. Providing examples of how the React API works with `React.CreateClass()` and wiring up a simple React App within an HTML document is a really good segway into how react fits together. Once we abstract that away with the `class` keyword it becomes really difficult to understand the context. This is impertive to learning the library and it's api at first.\n\n*Solution Code for the Afternoon Projects* \n\nStudents can follow along building this out during the lecture. Each objective you take it a step further. Starting with `React.createElement()` -> then `JSX` -> then -> `components`. This will allow you to see the progression of this come to fruition right before your eyes. AND the students LOVE it.\n\nhttps://gist.github.com/ryanhca/b23529ae7aaf28f885ead2eed955852a\n\nI have added a step to the above. I have been creating a custom createElement function that takes in a type, a className, and content and creates a custom element. Then it returns that custom element, and we add it to the DOM. The I replace my custom function with React.createElement. Here is the example gist:\n\nhttps://gist.github.com/dustinmyers/9a5bd605e2c85aeb3ecbd63315e370a3\n\n*Gotcha* for this lesson - Don't forget to teach how to import/export components in a regular file structure. This is required in the afternoon project, and it will really throw off students if it's not discussed.",

During this process, we will document our process and end up with a pseudo-code version of the algorithm.\n\nReview what the task is by taking another look at the readme.  Cover what we\u2019ve done so far, and what our next tasks are.\n\nAsk how the class did with their attempts to do a BFS on paper.  Also find out if anyone was able to implement random colors and/or the reset button.\n\n(Min 15-30)\nAs you complete the demonstrations in the next few segments\n\nOpen up the whiteboard and show the demo for the test.  Ask about connected components and have the class identify the ones present.  Discuss how it is easy for us to see this, but it is a more difficult problem for the computer, because the computer can only look at one thing at a time.  It can\u2019t see the bigger picture like we can.\n\nPick a starting spot.  Add this step to the process and ask the class to guide you through walking step by step across the graph.  Think about what we need to write down to do so - the places we\u2019ve been, is the first thing, so write that down, and add this to the process.\n\nNext, we need to look at it\u2019s connections.  Since we can only look at them one at a time, we need to figure out which order to go in.  We know from our research that the BFS should start at the origin and expand outward.  Add exploring connections to the process. \n\nDemonstrate that it doesn\u2019t matter which order we go in, but it is important that you keep track of where you have been so that you don\u2019t get stuck in a loop.  Demonstrate following a few different orders of edges and add \u201cplaces visited\u201d to the list of things you need to keep track of.\nThis is a good place to reinforce the concept that this type of search does not find THE best answer to the problem.  It only finds an answer that is A best solution.  There may be many others that are equally good.\n\n(Min 30-60)\nAlthough the order we visit each edge of a particular vertex doesn\u2019t matter, the order in which vertexes are visited does matter.  In a breadth first search, the definition states that they should be visited in the order that they are discovered.\n\nAsk what kind of programming structure is used to process items in a first-in-first-out basis and find the answer of a queue.  Add a queue to the paper structure and demonstrate it in operation.\n\nDemonstrate that process can be modified to add vertexes to the visited list when they are discovered, rather than when they are actually visited, so that the presence or absence of the vertex in the visited list can be used to determine if it should be added to the queue or not.  \n\nFurther demonstrate the search and use this demonstration to further refine the written process.\n\n(Min 60-65)\nBreak\n\n(Min 65-90)\nFurther refine the process to\n\nCreate a group designation and mark each discovered vertex with that group\nHandle situations where the queue is empty\nGo to the next unvisited vertex going by order of label\nIncrement the group number\n\nFinish the run-through of the process on the first graph, further refining it if necessary.\n\n(Min 90-105)\n\nPull up the second graph.  Ask the class to lead you through a complete run through.  Follow their instructions and only correct if they are off track.  Try to get as many students as possible to participate in giving instructions.\n\nShow that the process can also be modified to track the parent of each vertex.  This gives the shortest path from any vertex, back to the first in the collection.\n\nFurther refine the process into pseudo-code if needed.\n\nMin (105-110)\n\nAnswer questions.\n\n(Min 110 - 120)\n\nWhat should the class do with project time?\n\nRefer to the readme for remaining tasks.  Project time today should be used to implement BFS in code.  A few pointers to share:\nThe stated goal is to color each connected component.  There are two approaches that will work.  \nCreate a random color for each set and mark the color of each vertex when it is visited.\nCreate a list of connected components and use the list do the colors at drawing time\nThe BFS algorithm should find one connected component.  It needs to be called several times to find them all\n\n\n#####################DAY 3:########################\n\n\nObjectives Covered\n* describe a depth-first search and its uses...\n\nOther goals                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 \n* Complete the BFS in code.\n\nPrecourse Video Topics\nThe precourse video covers depth first searches. \n\n(Min 0 - 10)\n\nCheck in with the class and poll viewership of the pre-course video. \n\nSet the stage!  Share an overview of what the agenda for the day and week are going to be.\n\nToday we are going to switch gears for a moment, and start with learning how to do a depth-first search on the whiteboard, and come up with pseudo-code - the same process we did yesterday, but a different approach.\n\nAsk the class to explain a depth first search and how it differs from BFS.  A DFS can be thought of as being the opposite of a BFS.  Rather than moving outward in rings, and dealing with vertexes in the order that they are discovered, we move outward as far as possible, and explore any vertex immediately on discovery.  When we get to a dead end, we retreat until we can move outward again.\n\nDo a quick demonstration of the path that is taken without worrying too much about the process for this pass.\n\nDiscuss how the result of a DFS is A minimum spanning tree, showing the smallest connection between the vertexes.  As with BFS, the result can be one of many possible best results, but it will be tied for the best.\n\n(Min 10-40)\nOpen the third sample graph in the whiteboard.\n\nRepeat the process from yesterday to build a process for a depth first search.  Start with discussing the differences in which vertex is given priority and using a stack vs. a queue.\n\nThe process from yesterday can be modified, or a new one created.  The end result should be similar to:\n\nIf the stack is empty, add the next unvisited node to the stack and increment the group number and mark it visited and as being in the new group\nMove to the node at the top of the stack\nIf the node has an unvisited connection, mark that connection as visited and add it to the top of the stack and go to step 2\nIf there are no unvisited connections, remove the node from the top of the stack and go to step 2\n\nGuide the class as needed to stay on time, but try to let them devise the solution.\n\n(Min 40-50)\nLet the class know that we are switching back to BFS.  Erase the whiteboard marks from the DFS, and lead the class through a fast repetition of the BFS.\n\n(Min 50-55)\nBreak\n\n(Min 55-70)\nNow, it is time to convert our process and/or pseudocode into actual code.  First, we need to figure out where to do this.\n\nAsk the class how to approach the problem and where to put the code.  We could start a new files, or put it in one of our existing ones.\n\nAs always, the answer is to check the docs and existing code.  In this case, the docs aren\u2019t very helpful, though the do include another pseudocode version of BFS.  A re-review of the code gives the answer - our colleague has set up stubs for where this code should go.\nWe should also think about how we are going to test the large and complicated function we are about to write.  \n\nAsk the class why randomize might not be the best function to test with.  The answer, as before, is that anything that produces random data has a higher risk of obscuring issues with debugging and may give the appearance of a correct result when bugs still remain.  As such, we should switch back to our test data.\n\nAdjust debugCreateTestData() so that it will build a few small sets of connected components.\n\nWe also need to figure out where to call BFS.  Lead a discussion with the class and come to the conclusion that for now, it makes sense to call BFS immediately after graph.vertexes is filled by debugCreateTestData().  Add the call.  It needs an argument for the start parameter, so feed it graph.vertexes[0] for now.\n\n(Min 70-105)\n\nNext it would be good to do a simple test to make sure that it is being called and everything is connected the way we think it is.  \n\nA good way to start would be to use the function to change the color of a vertex.  Create a variable for groupColor and initialize it as \u201cred\u201d. \n\nAsk how we should tell the first vertex to be the groupColor, and have the class prompt you that vertex has a variable for color.  Make start.color = groupColor.\n\nRun it and ask why it hasn\u2019t changed the color of the vertex.  The answer is that we still have the fill color in our drawing code hard-coded to be \u201cwhite\u201d.  Change this to vertex.color.\n\nThe first vertex should now render red.  Now we need to get more of them to be changed to groupColor.  We need to convert the pseudo-code into actual code.  What was our pseudo-code again?\n\nAs always, the answer is to look at the docs.  In this case, we\u2019ve actually made the documentation ourselves!  Refer back to the whiteboard where the process is written down.  Copy it, and paste it as comments into bfs().\n\nAsk the class to look at the pseudocode/process.  We already have our variable for group, is there anything else we need?  We need a queue.  What type of data structure makes the most sense to store a list of items in a specified order?  An array.  Create an array for queue.\n\nNext take a look at the overall process.  We know that we need to do some kind of loop involving the queue array,, but we\u2019re going to be adding and removing stuff, and we don\u2019t know at the start how many items we need to deal with.  Ask what kind of loop is best for this - a while loop.  \n\nWhat is the condition that we should keep going?  If the queue is not empty.  This also means that we need to \u201cprime the pump\u201d  \n\nAdd the while loop, and above it add the vertex in start to the array.  \n\nWhat\u2019s next?  According to the pseudo-code, we need to loop through each edge in the vertex, and add where it points to the queue, and mark it as being visited.  Since we know exactly how many times we need to iterate, we can use a for each loop.  \n\nHow do we tell if a vertex has been visited?  We could make a list of the ones that have been visited and check against that, but we can also use the properties within each vertex.  They start with a color of \u201cwhite\u201d, so we can change the color when we find each one, and use that to both tell if it is undiscovered and change the color for drawing.\n\nInside the loop, if an edge has a destination that has a color that is not white:\nChange the color to groupColor\nAdd the destination to the end of the queue array (push)\n\nRun and test the code several times.  Fix any bugs, and ask the class to observe what is happening and theorize why.\n\nWhatever connected component the first vertex is in will turn red, but no other components will change.  Why?  Because we haven\u2019t yet done the last part of the pseudocode - if the queue becomes empty, we are done with this set and should move to the next connected component.\n\nHow can this be translated to code?  There are several approaches, but a clue was given to us by our colleague in the connected components stub.\n\nWe can use the getConnectedComponents() function to call bfs() for each vertex, if that vertex has not yet been visited.  Add a for each loop of the vertexes list and call bfs on each vertex that has not yet had its color changed.\n\nTest and observe that nothing has changed - because we forgot to call the new function.  Ask where this should go, and lead the class to the answer that it should replace where bfs() is called in app.js\n\nWe\u2019re almost done, but everything is turning red, and that\u2019s not what we want - we want each connected component to be a different random color.\n\nAsk the class how to generate a random color, then use google and grab a function and add it to graphs.js.  Discuss other potential locations for this type of function.  If there are going to be a lot of similar types of functions in the project, it\u2019s often good to move them to a separate file of helper functions.  But for now, it\u2019s fine to add it above bfs().\n\nNow, all that is needed is to use the random color function to generate groupColor, rather than hardcoding.\n\nBuild, run, debug, and test.  Time permitting, change the debug data around to confirm that it still works.\n\nThe last step is to swap out debugCreateTestData() with randomize() again.  Test to confirm that it works, and we are done.\n\nMin 105-110)\n\nAnswer questions.\n\n(Min 110 - 120)\n\nWhat should the class do with project time?\n\nReview the readme, because whenever we are unsure of what to do next, this is where we look - specs/docs/etc. \n\nWe have phase 5 and 6 left, except for students who have already completed it earlier.  The remaining project time should be used to complete those phases, then work on the stretch to add weights to the project and implement Djikstra.\n\n\n",

He only published because he handed a 50-page manuscript sample to his 8-year-old daughter and she came down after reading it and pestered him to get more of the book. He realized he had a winner on his hands. The point of his story is that testing with real users makes a huge difference. We \"experts\" are not always the real judges of what's good.\n\nHere's an article about the original J.K. Rowling story:\n\nhttps://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/books/news/revealed-the-eight-year-old-girl-who-saved-harry-potter-296456.html \n\n```The story [publisher Nigel Newton] tells in a rare personal interview is almost as unlikely as one of Rowling's muggles-and-magic plots. Bloomsbury, the off-beat company named after the 1920s London literary set, was just about the last chance for Rowling to get the original Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone into print.\n\nHer agent, Christopher Little, called at Bloomsbury Publishing's cramped offices in Soho Square and gave Newton a sample to read. He took it home but, instead of settling down with it himself, handed it to Alice, then eight years old.\n\n\"She came down from her room an hour later glowing,\" Newton recalls, \"saying, 'Dad, this is so much better than anything else.' She nagged and nagged me in the following months, wanting to see what came next.\"\n\nNewton made out a cheque to Joanne Kathleen Rowling for just \u00a32,500, which has since proved one of the wisest investments in publishing history.\n\n....\n\n\"It was very fortunate for us,\" said Newton. \"We'd only just started to publish children's books in June 1994. And we hit it lucky.\" He told The Independent on Sunday that \"eight others turned J K Rowling down; ie, the whole lot\".\n```",

The most basic of these ideas is the common function\n\n    y = f(x)\n\nThis unassuming function is the foundation of all modern industry and science. It also is important to Machine Learning.\n\nIn this sprint we will learn about functions. Some functions are specified with perfect knowledge by a mathematician, and other functions are only observed. When we observe a function, we don't know the underlying function but only the data observations we have made.\n\nMachine Learning - and data science and statistics more broadly - is the process of building models that can identify the unknown function. Lets talk about known and unknown functions.\n\nBefore we can start studying functions for Machine Learning, we need a good working `python` environment. Fortunately, Google recently produced an online python environment that makes learning ML a snap:\n\nhttps://colab.research.google.com",

How do we perform this validation? We will utilize the Goodness of Fit Test or in this case the \u201cChi-square\u201d technique.\n\nTo summarize, the Goodness of Fit Test will help us determine whether our observed data for last year follows the \u201chistorical\u201d probability distribution.\n",

However, a LOT of projects will still have class components in them, and we need to be prepared to work with classes when we see them.",

(Supervised vs Unsupervised, Regression vs Classification)\n\n2) Look at our first Machine Learning algorithm which happens to be an unsupervised learning algorithm - K-Means Clustering! Why are we starting with this algorithm? Because it involves high dimensional data, typically works well when combined with PCA, and will help tie together some of the intuition that we have been working towards building over the course of the week.\n\n3) Briefly discuss the No Free Lunch Principle (NFL) Which basically states that the more we optimize an algorithm for solving one specific kind of problem, the worse it gets at solving all other kinds of problems. This is highly pertinent to clustering algorithms, but the biggest takeaway from the NFL principle is that there is no single approach that is going to be the best for every circumstance. The tools you use have to be informed by the data that you're working with and the context of the problem that you're trying to solve. ",

You are to treat this week as if you are building this application at a company and the instructor is your client. The project managers (including section lead) will be your main support throughout the week.\n\n\nThe main objective of this week is to develop the MVP features of your application. There are a few requirements that you should do before starting this project:\n\n- You must present your idea to your instructor and have them approve it. This idea can be anything you want, taking into account you will have from Monday through half of Thursday to work on it. Try to keep it feasible given the length of time you have!\n- A solid project plan/research. More details on this below.\n\n\n## Project Research and Planning\n\nA vital part of any project is planning and research, and writing an application is no exception. This is especially true of a project that you have a deadline for, such as this one and any project you work on at your future job. \n\nFailure to do proper research can result in a significantly shorter amount of time spent working on your application. You may not be a much of a \"planner\", however being able to research and plan out any project including this one is extremely beneficial. We've been able to see hundreds of students build projects with similar time constraints to this one; the end result between a well-planned project and a poorly or not planned project is often staggering.\n\nOnce you know what kind of project you want to write, take time to do a bit of research. In order to facilitate this process, use the project planner [found here](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/16965587/51573635-6c5cda00-1e67-11e9-93c8-66e73b034456.png). Please watch the video on how to effectively use this project planner as well.\n\nIn the past, students have wanted to use APIs that they had to email the maintainer for an API key instead of getting one immediately upon signing up to use the API. When researching APIs to use and come across one like this be wary. If you email them even over the weekend before this project week, there is no guarantee that they will respond. Consider finding another API that has similar information/functionality before resorting to using one like that.\n\nThis principle applies to anything you aren't absolutely sure about. Doing the research **before** you even make an Android Studio project and realize that something won't work the way you thought it would is going to save you time and frustration.\n\nProject planning will provide you with a good roadmap to know how long you have to work on each feature and have a **solid** idea of what needs to be done before diving head-first into the project.",

Unit tests in real codebases require lots of mocking and make lots of assumptions, and may not really test interactions/corner cases as much as integration tests.\n\nAlso, emphasize that unit tests are sometimes valuable not for the tests themselves but for them encouraging you to refactor your code into small units in the first place.",

            "Description": "Convolutional neural networks are a deep learning architecture that further draws from biological inspiration, using a neuron connectivity pattern that resembles the visual/receptive fields of a real brain. Neurons are more or less receptive to different parts of the input, depending on the transformation (convolution) that is applied.\n\nThe resulting models are extremely effective at image recognition and classification problems, requiring little data pre-processing and exhibiting results competitive with (or better than!) humans. They can also be applied to other areas, including content-based recommender systems, video recognition, and NLP tagging/predictions.",

After this week, normal everyday problems you'll get at work will seem relatively trivial.\n\nThe most important thing for these first two days is to _practice_ solving these hard problems. We're less concerned that you get the answer than that you _try super hard_ to get the answer. It's 10 points for copying the answer online, 1000000 points for working hard on the problem, and 1 additional bonus point for getting the answer.\n\nIt's the process of attacking the problem that gets you the learning gain. You'll get out what you put in.\n\nWe have some pre-class vids to watch on TK to get started with:\n\n* _Runtime Complexity_\n* _Recursion_\n* _A First Pass Solution_\n\nGive 'em a watch before class so we can hit the ground running.\n\nhttps://learn.lambdaschool.com/cs/module/recrcuzqmvi6lvxhd\n\nIf you want to get a head start on the week's material, you can find the repo here: https://github.com/LambdaSchool/Algorithms\n\nHave a good weekend!\n__________\n\n## Day 1\n\n__________\n@channel It's day 1 of Algorithms! Let's get started!\n\n* Why are we discussing this?\n* Some simple algorithms\n* Algorithmic analysis and Big-O\n__________\n\nTalk more about recursion in depth. Use recursion to solve the recursive string permutations problem. Also walk students through the problem of implementing a stack class that can always access the largest element in the stack in constant time. Use this problem as an opportunity to talk about how to improve the runtime of some functionality from O(n) to O(1). \n    1. Write a recursive contains function that receives an array and a target and returns True if the target is in the array and False otherwise.\n\n    2. Implement a stack class with all the usual stack functionality, and with the added functionality that it can access the largest element in the stack in constant time. \n\n\n___________\n\n@channel More vids for your viewing pleasure!\n\nBack on TK for algorithms, Sean chats about improving a first-pass solution. It's additional coverage on dynamic programming and other techniques.\n\nhttps://learn.lambdaschool.com/cs/module/recrcuzqmvi6lvxhd\n\nAnd then on the data structures side, the first two vids, _Linked Lists_ and _Queues_ (~25 mins total) are a good start after you wrap your Algs stuff.\n\nhttps://learn.lambdaschool.com/cs/module/recuhkmtdyvwmexmz\n\nRemember: when you're working out the algorithms problems, look on them as sources of curiosity rather than frustration. They way problems behave when you attack them is something to be studied and explored here in the safety of Lambda.\n___________\n\n\n## Day 2\n\n```\n/polly \"I attacked the following problems (check all that apply)\" \"Stocks\" \"Recipes\" \"Stairs\" \"RPS\" \"Change\" \"Knapsack\"\n\n/polly \"I solved the following problems (check all that apply)\" \"Stocks\" \"Recipes\" \"Stairs\" \"RPS\" \"Change\" \"Knapsack\"\n\n/polly \"Confidence on Big-O\" \"0%\" \"25%\" \"50%\" \"75%\" \"100%\"\n```\n\nTalk about some different algorithmic problem-solving approaches such as the greedy approach. Note that the term \"greedy approach\" is different from the greedy heuristic that might be used as a strategy in order to get a \"good enough\" answer to the knapsack problem. Use it to solve the problem of finding the highest product of 3 integers in an array in linear time. Use these problems as an opportunity to look at how to improve the runtime of an initial first-pass algorithm.\n    1. Given an array of integers, find the highest product of any three integers in the array in linear time.\n\n    2. Given an array of integers, find the cumulative product of every integer except the one at the current index.\n",

My name's Beej--I'm one of the instructors here at LS and I'm stoked to be working with you this coming week.\n\nWe're about to start Algorithms! :wooooo: \n\nThis is one of the most challenging weeks at Lambda, and it comes out swinging. It's incredibly difficult material for virtually everyone, myself included. If the answers don't immediately spring out at you, welcome to the club. :slightly_smiling_face: \n\nBut no one goes to the gym to have an easy time of things. We're going to work hard and reap those benefits. After this week, normal everyday problems you'll get at work will seem relatively trivial.\n\nThe most important thing for these first two days is to _practice_ solving these hard problems. We're less concerned that you get the answer than that you _try super hard_ to get the answer. It's 10 points for copying the answer online, 1000000 points for working hard on the problem, and 1 additional bonus point for getting the answer.\n\nIt's the process of attacking the problem that gets you the learning gain. You'll get out what you put in.\n\nWe have some pre-class vids to watch on TK to get started with:\n\n* _Runtime Complexity_\n* _Recursion_\n* _A First Pass Solution_\n\nGive 'em a watch before class so we can hit the ground running.\n\nhttps://learn.lambdaschool.com/cs/module/recrcuzqmvi6lvxhd\n\nIf you want to get a head start on the week's material, you can find the repo here: https://github.com/LambdaSchool/Algorithms\n\nHave a good weekend!\n__________\n\n## Day 1\n\n__________\n@channel It's day 1 of Algorithms! Let's get started!\n\n* Why are we discussing this?\n* Some simple algorithms\n* Algorithmic analysis and Big-O\n__________\n\nTalk more about recursion in depth. Use recursion to solve the recursive string permutations problem. Also walk students through the problem of implementing a stack class that can always access the largest element in the stack in constant time. Use this problem as an opportunity to talk about how to improve the runtime of some functionality from O(n) to O(1). \n    1. Write a recursive contains function that receives an array and a target and returns True if the target is in the array and False otherwise.\n\n    2. Implement a stack class with all the usual stack functionality, and with the added functionality that it can access the largest element in the stack in constant time. \n\n\n___________\n\n@channel More vids for your viewing pleasure!\n\nBack on TK for algorithms, Sean chats about improving a first-pass solution. It's additional coverage on dynamic programming and other techniques.\n\nhttps://learn.lambdaschool.com/cs/module/recrcuzqmvi6lvxhd\n\nAnd then on the data structures side, the first two vids, _Linked Lists_ and _Queues_ (~25 mins total) are a good start after you wrap your Algs stuff.\n\nhttps://learn.lambdaschool.com/cs/module/recuhkmtdyvwmexmz\n\nRemember: when you're working out the algorithms problems, look on them as sources of curiosity rather than frustration. They way problems behave when you attack them is something to be studied and explored here in the safety of Lambda.\n___________\n\n\n## Day 2\n\n```\n/polly \"I attacked the following problems (check all that apply)\" \"Stocks\" \"Recipes\" \"Stairs\" \"RPS\" \"Change\" \"Knapsack\"\n\n/polly \"I solved the following problems (check all that apply)\" \"Stocks\" \"Recipes\" \"Stairs\" \"RPS\" \"Change\" \"Knapsack\"\n\n/polly \"Confidence on Big-O\" \"0%\" \"25%\" \"50%\" \"75%\" \"100%\"\n```\n\nTalk about some different algorithmic problem-solving approaches such as the greedy approach. Note that the term \"greedy approach\" is different from the greedy heuristic that might be used as a strategy in order to get a \"good enough\" answer to the knapsack problem. Use it to solve the problem of finding the highest product of 3 integers in an array in linear time. Use these problems as an opportunity to look at how to improve the runtime of an initial first-pass algorithm.\n    1. Given an array of integers, find the highest product of any three integers in the array in linear time.\n\n    2. Given an array of integers, find the cumulative product of every integer except the one at the current index.\n",

Viewport links and examples would be super nice.  Using a device emulator to show case how things look without a viewport.  Good examples and non-examples would be great here.  \n    * https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Viewport\n* Go from viewport to actual code examples that start with max and min width.  Explain that max is width and down and min is width and up.\n    * https://codepen.io/lambdaschool/pen/JLmWPb?editors=1100\n* Introduce media queries and explain how they are important.\n    * https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/@media\n* Give code examples of media queries and ask the students to update the 3 boxes based on media queries\n    * https://codepen.io/lambdaschool/pen/eMPpZx\n* Move into what mobile first and desktop first approaches look like.  Have examples and non-examples ready\n    * A good example of mobile first is https://getbootstrap.com/\n* Show the project design material and address the mobile navigation.\n    * https://github.com/LambdaSchool/Responsive-Web-Design",

            "Description": "Up through this point, as you have been working through the Web curriculum, even though data structures were never officially introduced, you were making extensive use of them all the time. Python lists and dictionaries are so useful and versatile that they were included as standard in the language. \n\nIndeed, data structures are extremely prevalent and fundamental when it comes to understanding programming and computer science. By the end of the Computer Science curriculum, you'll have a good idea of the answers to important questions that were raised during the web curriculum such as 'how do web servers such as Express effectively and efficiently handle hundreds or thousands of concurrent requests simultaneously?' or 'how does a database like MongoDB organize the data that it stores in such a way that it can then retrieve it as quickly as possible?'. Such questions can be answered in part by having an understanding of both the wide berth of all the currently-existing data structures that have been dreamt as well as an adequately deep understanding of how many common data structures work.  \n\nAs part of your first Data Structures sprint, we'll be learning about and implementing some very common and fundamental data structures that are very often used to implement more complex and specialized data structures. These are the:\n \n - Linked List\n - Queue\n - Binary Search Tree\n - Heap\n\nEach of these data structures has its own associated strengths and weaknesses. Think of each of them as a tool in a toolbox. You have entirely different classes of tools such as hammers and wrenches that are each used for entirely different use cases. You also have multiple types of screwdrivers. Both are used for tightening and untightening screws, but the Phillips screwdriver is better for certain screws and the flathead screwdriver is better for other types of screws. \n\nThe same can be said of data structures. There are many instances of wildly different data structures that serve entirely different use cases, and then you have data structures that _can_ both perform the same function, but one will be better at it than the other.  More specifically, you _could_ emulate the functionality of a JavaScript Array using an Object, but an Object isn't going to perform as efficiently when it comes to certain tasks that Arrays are really efficient at. \n\n## A Note About Data Structures in Different Language Contexts\nLet's go back to the topic of linked lists seeming redundant in Python. Why do we need to learn about linked lists when Python already provides for us such a full-featured array implementation (via lists) that can already do everything a linked list can do? Sure, linked lists have marginally better performance on certain operations when compared to arrays, but does that really justify the existence of the linked list data structure? \n\nThese are all entirely valid points; working in Python _does_ obviate the need to implement certain data structures such as linked lists and hash tables. This brings us to a core tenet of the Computer Science curriculum: the material that you'll be exposed to and learning about in the Computer Science curriculum will be almost entirely language-agnostic. Seasoned developers and programmers learn to sever the connection between coming up with a solution to a problem they're facing, and actually implementing that solution. That probably doesn't mean a lot right now, but as you go on to expand your knowledge horizons by learning about other programming languages such as C, you'll come to realize that different languages place different constraints on the programmer. Notably, in C, there is no full-featured array implementation. There's also no built-in hash table. Thus, you'll find that when it comes time to work in C, knowing how to implement data structures that seem obsolete in Python will have a payoff.\n\n## Additional Resources\n\n1. https://www.interviewcake.com/article/python/data-structures-coding-interview?course=dsa does a great job of motivating and introducing most of the data structures we cover in this sprint. \n\n2.

If you code along with the videos, above, you'll be a day ahead of the game.\n\nhttps://learn.lambdaschool.com/cs/module/recvcvxozkm5cyoc4\n\nHave a fun weekend!\n__________\n\nI didn't livecode the whole notes demo since they see it all in the videos. But I code up enough of it to livecode through Q&A as necessary.\n\nBecause this week is light, one option is to use the time to talk about GraphQL a bit. There's a repo with some sample code here: https://github.com/LambdaSchool/GraphQL . This isn't something that the students clone, but has some READMEs in it.\n\nThe Q&A is an opportunity to repeat material that might need more coverage. Polly can help ID this.\n\nPre-class videos for Day 1 in announcement, above.\n\nDay 1:\n```\n/polly \"What should we cover in Q&A?\" \"Setup\" \"Migrations\" \"Models\" \"Python shell\" \".env files\"\n/polly \"Confidence in knowledge level for Django and Django models?\" \"0 - low\" \"1\" \"2\" \"3 - high\"\n```\n\n* Q&A about setup/migrations/env\n* GraphQL\n\nPre-class videos for Day 2: _Admin interface_, _Migrations II_, _Subclassing Models_, _SQL and ORM_.\n\nDay 2:\n```\n/polly \"What should we cover in Q&A?\" \"Admin interface\" \"Migrations with new fields\" \"Subclassing models\" \"SQL and the ORM\"\n/polly \"Confidence in knowledge level for Django admin interface?\" \"0 - low\" \"1\" \"2\" \"3 - high\"\n```\n* Q&A about pre-class vids.\n* GraphQL\n\nPre-class videos for Day 3 (in the _Building APIs_ TK page): _REST Framework_, _Creating Records_.",

Now you\u2019re going to continue building your Python proficiency and get started with another framework - Django. Your first goal - get set up, learn a bit about the system, and be able to make a simple \u201cHello Django\u201d application.\n\nDjango is, like Python, a pragmatic \u201cone right way to do it\u201d system, specifically a web application framework built on the principles of convention over configuration and fast iterative design. It is \u201cbatteries included\u201d, which means it comes with ways to do most common web application tasks (data models, ORM, templates, forms, validation, auth, etc.).\n\nThe Django ecosystem bills itself as \u201cthe web framework for perfectionists with deadlines\u201d - these many included features are what makes it quick to build an MVP with. We will start by learning about and using these components, and then move on to extend the system and (to some extent) pick and choose the modules we actually want.\n\nFor now, get started by setting out on the objectives, setting up a Python/Django development environment and making a basic Django app. There are also many linked resources to check out for each objective, Django has an excellent community with lots of helpful tutorials and documentation.\n\nHave fun getting started with Django!",

In other words, $Ax = b$ doesn't have a unique solution $x$, and so traditional OLS approaches fail.\n\nRelatedly, overfitting can occur in situations where OLS technically \"works\", but the structure of what is being predicted relative to the overall dimensionality of the model is such that the model aligns too tightly with the points, and doesn't generalize or have predictive value.\n\nOne approach to mitigate these problems is regularization - adding information to the model, in order to make it more tractable. In particular, we will consider a common regularized model, ridge regression, which is based on [Tikhonov regularization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tikhonov_regularization).",

Creativity can get stymied by the familiarity and repetitiveness of designing within specific constraints for a long time. Sometimes it\u2019s also hard to decide whether a creative idea will be useful and worth pursuing. Design Thinking is a loose methodology that emerged from engineering and industrial design, starting in the 1960s. Over time some organizations have promoted Design Thinking as an almost branded tool for generating new solutions to problems. Businesses leaders have also subsumed the concept as a way to strengthen their own business creativity. The design firm IDEO is one organization that has popularized the term Design Thinking, teaching courses in Design Thinking and following Design Thinking processes in its contract work. The Stanford D.School also teaches Design Thinking as a foundational process for design. Some folks decry Design Thinking as just common sense and that it doesn\u2019t deserve the attention paid to it, but as Design Thinking helps provide order and structure to a sometimes convoluted and meandering process, it\u2019s worth exploring and understanding more.

In our case, we will be using LESS.  \n* When using your own styles to overwrite bootstrap, use custom classes with heavier specificity as a best practice.\n* DO NOT try to go into the bootstrap core files and make updates there.  This will lead to bootstrap performing in ways the documentation does not guarantee. \n* Teach students that CSS is still king and their styles will always win in a specificity war against bootstrap.\n* Go under the hood a bit and show students that bootstrap is simply CSS and JS.",

Walk the students through what happens when you type a URL into a browser. Here, we won't take caching into account, as that will be talked about in Web Server II. Steps are outlined below:\n\n```\n1. Browser asks OS for server's IP address.\n2. OS makes a DNS lookup and replies to the browser with the requested IP address.\n3. Browser opens a connection to the server (we'll assume a TCP connection in this case). This step is much more complex with HTTPS. \n4. Browser sends the HTTP request through TCP connection.\n5. Browser receives HTTP response and may close the TCP connection, or reuse it for another request.\n6. Browser checks if the response is a redirect or a conditional response (3xx result status codes), authorization request (401), error (4xx and 5xx), etc.; these are handled differently from normal responses (2xx).\n7. Browser decodes response (e.g. if it's gzipped).\n8. Browser uses the MIME-type of the response to determine what to do with it (e.g. is it a HTML page, is it an image, is it a sound clip?).\n9. Browser renders response content, or offers a download dialog for unrecognized types.\n```\n\n2. Talk about how the internet works more generally. Possible topics include routing, DNS resolution, CDNs, etc. \nhttp://www.theshulers.com/whitepapers/internet_whitepaper/index.html\n\n3.

            "Description": "An old army aphorism made popular by Dwight Eisenhower is this: \u201cPlans are worthless but planning is everything.\u201d \n\nYou'll find that often the careful designs you create as part of the UX design process are challenged and changed as they move forward. That's expected, but jumping into a design project without sufficient context will almost invariably result in failure. Some of the most fundamental planning work you can do to prepare for a project is to evaluate the assumptions you have about the product and the audience and evaluating the competitive landscape.\n\nThis is the process by which we begin to plan for our designs. It gives our design process a solid foundation and is part of our Discovery efforts in the product design cycle.",
